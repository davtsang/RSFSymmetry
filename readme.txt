Resonant Shattering Flares as Multimessenger Probes of Nuclear Symmetry Energy

Duncan Neill, William G. Newton, and David Tsang

The behaviour of the nuclear symmetry energy near saturation density is important for our understanding of dense nuclear matter. This density dependence can be parameterised by the nuclear symmetry energy and its derivatives evaluated at nuclear saturation density. In this work, we show that the core-crust interface mode of a neutron star is sensitive to these parameters, through the (density-weighted) shear-speed within the crust, which is in turn dependent on the symmetry energy profile of dense matter. We calculate the frequency at which the neutron star quadrupole ($\ell = 2$) crust-core interface mode must be driven by the tidal field of its binary partner to trigger a Resonant Shattering Flare (RSF). We demonstrate that coincident multimessenger timing of a RSF and gravitational wave chirp from a neutron star merger would enable us to place strong constraints on the symmetry energy parameters, competitive with those from current nuclear experiments.
