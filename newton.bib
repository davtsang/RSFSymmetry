	Abstract = {We calculate the equation of state of neutron matter with realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions using quantum Monte Carlo techniques and illustrate that the short-range three-neutron interaction determines the correlation between neutron matter energy at nuclear saturation density and higher densities relevant to neutron stars. Our model also makes an experimentally testable prediction for the correlation between the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence---determined solely by the strength of the short-range terms in the three-neutron force. The same force provides a significant constraint on the maximum mass and radius of neutron stars.},

@article{Baillot-dEtivaux:2019aa,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new analysis of the thermal emission from the neutron star (NS) surface to constrain the dense matter equation of state. We employ an empirical parameterization of the equation of state with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to consistently fit the spectra of quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters with well-measured distances. Despite previous analyses predicting low NS radii, we show that it is possible to reconcile the astrophysical data with nuclear physics knowledge with or without including a prior on the slope of the symmetry energy L <SUB>sym</SUB>. With this empirical parameterization of the equation of state, we obtain radii of the order of about 12 km without worsening the fit statistic. More importantly, we obtain the following values for the slope of the symmetry energy, its curvature K <SUB>sym</SUB>, and the isoscalar skewness parameter Q <SUB>sat</SUB>:  L <SUB>sym</SUB> = 37.2 <SUB>-8.9</SUB><SUP>+9.2</SUP> MeV,  K <SUB>sym</SUB> =- 85 <SUB>-70</SUB><SUP>+82</SUP> MeV, and  Q <SUB>sat</SUB> = 318 <SUB>-366</SUB><SUP>+673</SUP> MeV. These are the first measurements of the empirical parameters K <SUB>sym</SUB> and Q <SUB>sat</SUB>. Their values are only weakly impacted by our assumptions, such as the distances or the number of free empirical parameters, provided the latter are taken within a reasonable range. We also study the weak sensitivity of our results to the set of sources analyzed, and we identify a group of sources that dominates the constraints. The resulting masses and radii obtained from this empirical parameterization are also compared to other measurements from electromagnetic observations of NSs and gravitational wave signals from the NS-NS merger GW170817.},

@article{Lattimer:2013tw,
	Abstract = {One of the major uncertainties in the dense matter equation of state has been the nuclear symmetry energy. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is important in nuclear astrophysics, as it controls the neutronization of matter in core-collapse supernovae, the radii of neutron stars and the thicknesses of their crusts, the rate of cooling of neutron stars, and the properties of nuclei involved in r-process nucleosynthesis. We show that fits of nuclear masses to experimental masses, combined with other experimental information from neutron skins, heavy ion collisions, giant dipole resonances, and dipole polarizabilities, lead to stringent constraints on parameters that describe the symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. These constraints are remarkably consistent with inferences from theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter, and, furthermore, with astrophysical observations of neutron stars. The concordance of experimental, theoretical, and observational analyses suggests that the symmetry parameters S<SUB>v</SUB> and L are in the range 29.0-32.7 MeV and 40.5-61.9 MeV, respectively, and that the neutron star radius, for a 1.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB> star, is in the narrow window 10.7 km &lt;R &lt; 13.1 km (90% confidence). We can also set tight limits to the size of neutron star crusts and the fractional moment of inertia they contain, as well as the overall moment of inertia and quadrupole polarizability of 1.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB> stars. Our results also have implications for the disk mass and ejected mass of compact mergers involving neutron stars.},

	Abstract = {Determining the Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter is a shared goal of both nuclear physics and astrophysics. Except possible phase transitions, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry E<SUB>sym</SUB>(ρ ) is the most uncertain part of the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter especially at supra-saturation densities. Much progresses have been made in recent years in predicting the symmetry energy and understanding why it is still very uncertain using various microscopic nuclear many-body theories and phenomenological models. Simultaneously, significant progresses have also been made in probing the symmetry energy in both terrestrial nuclear laboratories and astrophysical observatories. In light of the GW170817 event as well as ongoing or planned nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations probing the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter, we review recent progresses and identify new challenges to the best knowledge we have on several selected topics critical for understanding astrophysical effects of the nuclear symmetry energy.},

Our EoS are constrained only by input from hadron physics and fundamental principles, without feedback from neutron star observations, and so without relying on general relativity (GR). They can therefore be used to test GR itself, as well as modified gravity theories, with neutron star observables, without logical circularity. We have adapted state of the art results from NN chiral potentials for the low-density limit, pQCD results for the asymptotically high-density EoS, and use monotony and causality as the only restrictions for intermediate densities, for the EoS sets to remain as model-independent as is feasible today.},

	Abstract = {Using as references the posterior probability distribution functions of the equation of state (EOS) parameters inferred from the radii of canonical neutron stars (NSs) reported by the LIGO/VIRGO and NICER Collaborations based on their observations of GW170817 and PSR J0030+0451, we investigate how future radius measurements of more massive NSs will improve our current knowledge about the EOS of superdense neutron-rich nuclear matter, especially its symmetry energy term. Within the Bayesian statistical approach using an explicitly isospin-dependent parametric EOS for the core of NSs, we infer the EOS parameters of superdense neutron-rich nuclear matter from three sets of imagined mass-radius correlation data representing typical predictions by various nuclear many-body theories, that is, the radius stays the same, decreases, or increases with increasing NS mass within $\pm$15% between 1.4 and 2.0 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The corresponding NS average density increases quickly or slowly or slightly decreases as the NS mass increases from 1.4 to 2.0 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. While the EOSs of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) inferred from the three data sets are approximately the same, the corresponding symmetry energies above about twice the saturation density of nuclear matter are very different, indicating that the radii of massive NSs carry important information about the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with little influence from the remaining uncertainties of the SNM EOS at suprasaturation densities.},

	Abstract = {By numerically inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation using an explicitly isospin-dependent parametric Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter, a restricted EOS parameter space is established using observational constraints on the radius, maximum mass, tidal deformability and causality condition of neutron stars (NSs). The constraining band obtained for the pressure as a function of energy (baryon) density is in good agreement with that extracted recently by the LIGO+Virgo Collaborations from their improved analyses of the NS tidal deformability in GW170817. Rather robust upper and lower boundaries on nuclear symmetry energies are extracted from the observational constraints up to about twice the saturation density ρ<SUB>0</SUB> of nuclear matter. More quantitatively, the symmetry energy at 2 ρ<SUB>0</SUB> is constrained to E<SUB>sym</SUB>(2 ρ<SUB>0</SUB>) =46 .9 $\pm$10 .1 MeV excluding many existing theoretical predictions scattered between E<SUB>sym</SUB>(2 ρ<SUB>0</SUB>) =15 and 100 MeV. Moreover, by studying variations of the causality surface where the speed of sound equals that of light at central densities of the most massive neutron stars within the restricted EOS parameter space, the absolutely maximum mass of neutron stars is found to be 2.40 M<SUB>☉</SUB> approximately independent of the EOSs used. This limiting mass is consistent with findings of several recent analyses and numerical general relativity simulations about the maximum mass of the possible super-massive remanent produced in the immediate aftermath of GW170817. deformability},

	Abstract = {We confront observational data from gravitational wave event GW170817 with microscopic modeling of the cold neutron star equation of state. We develop and employ a Bayesian statistical framework that enables us to implement constraints on the equation of state from laboratory measurements of nuclei and state-of-the-art chiral effective field theory methods. The energy density functionals constructed from the posterior probability distributions are then used to compute consistently the neutron star equation of state from the outer crust to the inner core, assuming a composition consisting of protons, neutrons, electrons, and muons. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the 95% credibility range of predicted neutron star tidal deformabilities (136 &lt;Λ &lt;519 ) for a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star is already consistent with the upper bound deduced from observations of the GW170817 event. However, we find that lower bounds on the neutron star tidal deformability will very strongly constrain microscopic models of the dense matter equation of state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the neutron star tidal deformability and the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at twice saturation density.},

	Abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves originating from a neutron-star merger, GW170817, by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations has recently provided new stringent limits on the tidal deformabilities of the stars involved in the collision. Combining this measurement with the existence of two-solar-mass stars, we generate a generic family of neutron-star-matter equations of state (EOSs) that interpolate between state-of-the-art theoretical results at low and high baryon density. Comparing the results to ones obtained without the tidal-deformability constraint, we witness a dramatic reduction in the family of allowed EOSs. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the maximal radius of a 1.4-solar-mass neutron star is 13.6 km, and that the smallest allowed tidal deformability of a similar-mass star is Λ (1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB>)=120 .},

	Abstract = {Continued observation of PSR J0737-3039, the double pulsar, is expected to yield a precise determination of its primary component's moment of inertia in the next few years. Since the moment of inertia depends sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure, such a measurement will constrain the equation of state of ultra-dense matter, which is believed to be universal. Independent equation-of-state constraints have already been established by the gravitational-wave measurement of neutron star tidal deformability in GW170817. Here, using well-known universal relations among neutron star observables, we translate the reported 90% credible bounds on tidal deformability into a direct constraint,  I <SUB>\star </SUB>= 1.15 <SUB>-0.24</SUB><SUP>+0.38</SUP>×  10 <SUP>45</SUP>   g    cm  <SUP>2</SUP>, on the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A.

	Abstract = {The upper bound of the speed of sound in dense nuclear matter is one of the most interesting but still unsolved problems in nuclear physics. Theoretical studies in connection with recent observational data of isolated neutron stars as well as binary neutron stars systems offer an excellent opportunity to shed light on this problem. In the present work, we suggest a method to directly relate the measured tidal deformability (polarizability) of binary neutron stars system (before merger) to the maximum neutron star mass scenario and possible upper bound on the speed of sound. This method is based on the simple but efficient idea that while the upper limit of the effective tidal deformability favors soft equations of state, the recent high measured values of neutron star mass favor stiff ones. In the present work, first, using a simple well established model we parametrize the stiffness of the equation of state with the help of the speed of sound. Second, in comparison with the recent observations by LIGO/VIRGO collaboration of two events, GW170817 and GW190425, we suggest possible robust constraints. Moreover, we evaluate and postulate, in the framework of the present method, what kind of future measurements could help us to improve the stringent of the constraints on the neutron star equation of state.},

	Abstract = {Multi-messenger observations of neutron star (NS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize nuclear astrophysics. They will improve our understanding of nucleosynthesis, provide insights about the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting matter at high densities, and enable tests of the theory of gravity and of dark matter. Here, we focus on the EOS, where both gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron-star mergers and X-ray observations from space-based detectors such as NICER will provide more stringent constraints on the structure of neutron stars. Furthermore, recent advances in nuclear theory have enabled reliable calculations of the EOS at low densities using effective field theory based Hamiltonians and advanced techniques to solve the quantum many-body problem. In this paper, we address how the first observation of GWs from GW170817 can be combined with modern calculations of the EOS to extract useful insights about the EOS of matter encountered inside neutron stars. We analyze the impact of various uncertainties, the role of phase transitions in the NS core, and discuss how future observations will improve our understanding of dense matter.},

	Abstract = {Context. Observations of heavy (⋍2 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) neutron stars, such as PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432, in addition to the recent measurement of tidal deformability from the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, place interesting constraints on theories of dense matter. Currently operating and future observatories, such as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA), are expected to collect information on the global parameters of neutron stars, namely masses and radii, with an accuracy of a few percent. Such accuracy will allow for precise comparisons of measurements to models of compact objects and significantly improve our understanding of the physics of dense matter. <BR /> Aims: The dense-matter equation of state is still largely unknown. We investigate how the accuracy of measurements expected from the NICER and ATHENA missions will improve our understanding of the dense-matter interior of neutron stars. <BR /> Methods: We compared global parameters of stellar configurations obtained using three different equations of state: a reference (SLy4 EOS) and two piecewise polytropes manufactured to produce mass-radius relations indistinguishable from an observational point of view, i.e. within the predicted error of radius measurement. We assumed observational errors on the radius determination corresponding to the accuracies expected for the NICER and ATHENA missions. The effect of rotation was examined using high-precision numerical relativity computations. Because masses and rotational frequencies might be determined very precisely in the most optimistic scenario, only the influence of observational errors on radius measurements was investigated. <BR /> Results: We show that $\pm$5% errors in radius measurement lead to 10% and 40% accuracy in central parameter estimations for low-mass and high-mass neutron stars, respectively. Global parameters, such as oblateness and surface area, can be established with 8-10% accuracy, even if only compactness (instead of mass and radius) is measured. We also report on the range of tidal deformabilities corresponding to the estimated masses of GW170817 for the assumed uncertainty in radius.},

	Abstract = {We present predictions for neutron star tidal deformabilities obtained from a Bayesian analysis of the nuclear equation of state, assuming a minimal model at high-density that neglects the possibility of phase transitions. The Bayesian posterior probability distribution is constructed from priors obtained from microscopic many-body theory based on realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, while the likelihood functions incorporate empirical information about the equation of state from nuclear experiments. The neutron star crust equation of state is constructed from the liquid drop model, and the core-crust transition density is found by comparing the energy per baryon in inhomogeneous matter and uniform nuclear matter. From the cold β -equilibrated neutron star equation of state, we then compute neutron star tidal deformabilities as well as the mass-radius relationship. Finally, we investigate correlations between the neutron star tidal deformability and properties of finite nuclei.},

It is found that suitably chosen experimental data on isoscalar and isovector modes of nuclear excitations together with the observed maximum neutron star mass constrain the EOS which displays a very good congruence with the GW170817 inspired one. The giant resonances in nuclei are found to be instrumental in limiting the tidal deformability parameter and the radius of a neutron star in somewhat narrower bounds.

Using the constraints on the EOS of SNM at suprasaturation densities from heavy-ion collisions together with the data of finite nuclei and the existence of 2 M<SUB>☉</SUB> neutron stars from electromagnetic observations, we show that the high-density symmetry energy cannot be too soft, which leads to lower bounds on dimensionless tidal deformability of Λ<SUB>1.4</SUB>≥193 and radius of R<SUB>1.4</SUB>≥11.1 km for 1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB> neutron star. Furthermore, we find that the recent constraint of Λ<SUB>1.4</SUB>≤580 from the gravitational wave signal GW170817 detected from the binary neutron star merger by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations rules out too-stiff high-density symmetry energy, leading to an upper limit of R<SUB>1.4</SUB>≤13.3 km . All these terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on strong, electromagnetic, and gravitational measurements together put stringent constraints on the high-density symmetry energy and the EOS of SNM, pure neutron matter, and neutron star matter.},

	Abstract = {The tidal measurement of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 allows us to probe nuclear physics that suffers less from astrophysical systematics compared to neutron star radius measurements with electromagnetic wave observations. A recent work found strong correlation among neutron-star tidal deformabilities and certain combinations of nuclear parameters associated with the equation of state. These relations were then used to derive bounds on such parameters from GW170817 assuming that the relations and neutron star masses are known exactly. Here, we expand on this important work by taking into account a few new considerations: (1) a broader class of equations of state; (2) correlations with the mass-weighted tidal deformability that was directly measured with GW170817; (3) how the relations depend on the binary mass ratio; (4) the uncertainty from equation of state variation in the correlation relations; (5) adopting the updated posterior distribution of the tidal deformability measurement from GW170817. Upon these new considerations, we find GW170817 90% confidence intervals on nuclear parameters (the incompressibility K<SUB>0</SUB>, its slope M<SUB>0</SUB>, and the curvature of symmetry energy K<SUB>sym ,0</SUB> at nuclear saturation density) to be 81 MeV ≤K<SUB>0</SUB>≤362 MeV , 1556 MeV ≤M<SUB>0</SUB>≤4971 MeV , and -259 MeV ≤K<SUB>sym ,0</SUB>≤32 MeV , which are more conservative than previously found with systematic errors more properly taken into account.},

	Abstract = {The nuclear symmetry energy is intimately connected with nuclear astrophysics. This contribution focuses on the estimation of the symmetry energy from experiment and how it is related to the structure of neutron stars. The most important connection is between the radii of neutron stars and the pressure of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation density n<SUB>s</SUB>. This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry energy parameters S<SUB>v</SUB> and L , the first two coefficients of a Taylor expansion of the symmetry energy around n<SUB>s</SUB>. We discuss constraints on these parameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that these constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively from a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical studies of pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints. To date, several different astrophysical measurements of neutron star radii have been attempted. Attention is focused on photospheric radius expansion bursts and on thermal emissions from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. While none of these observations can, at the present time, determine individual neutron star radii to better than 20% accuracy, the body of observations can be used with Bayesian techniques to effectively constrain them to higher precision. These techniques invert the structure equations and obtain estimates of the pressure-density relation of neutron star matter, not only near n<SUB>s</SUB>, but up to the highest densities found in neutron star interiors. The estimates we derive for neutron star radii are in concordance with predictions from nuclear experiment and theory.},

	Abstract = {The detection of GW170817, the first neutron star-neutron star merger observed by Advanced LIGO and Virgo, and its following analyses represent the first contributions of gravitational wave data to understanding dense matter. Parameterizing the high density section of the equation of state of both neutron stars through spectral decomposition, and imposing a lower limit on the maximum mass value, led to an estimate of the stars' radii of [ image ] km and [ image ] km (Abbott et al 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 161101). These values do not, however, take into account any uncertainty owed to the choice of the crust low-density equation of state, which was fixed to reproduce the SLy equation of state model (Douchin and Haensel 2001 Astron. Astrophys. 380 151). We here re-analyze GW170817 data and establish that different crust models do not strongly impact the mass or tidal deformability of a neutron star-it is impossible to distinguish between low-density models with gravitational wave analysis. However, the crust does have an effect on inferred radius. We predict the systematic error due to this effect using neutron star structure equations, and compare the prediction to results from full parameter estimation runs. For GW170817, this systematic error affects the radius estimate by 0.3 km, approximately [ image ] of the neutron stars' radii.},

The J <SUB>0</SUB> largely controls the maximum mass of neutron stars. While the EOS with J <SUB>0</SUB> = 0 is sufficiently stiff to support neutron stars as massive as 2.37 M <SUB>☉</SUB>, supporting the hypothetical ones as massive as 2.74 M <SUB>☉</SUB> (composite mass of GW170817) requires J <SUB>0</SUB> to be larger than its currently known maximum value of about 400 MeV and beyond the causality limit. The upper limit on the tidal deformability of Λ<SUB>1.4</SUB> = 800 from the recent observation of GW170817 is found to provide upper limits on some EOS parameters consistent with but far less restrictive than the existing constraints of other observables studied.},

	Abstract = {The neutron star crustal equation of state and transition point properties are computed within a unified metamodeling approach. A Bayesian approach is employed including two types of filters: Bulk nuclear properties are controlled from low-density effective field-theory predictions as well as the present knowledge from nuclear experiments, whereas the surface energy is adjusted on experimental nuclear masses. Considering these constraints, a quantitative prediction of crustal properties can be reached with controlled confidence intervals and increased precision with respect to previous calculations: ≈11 % dispersion on the crustal width and ≈27 % dispersion on the fractional moment of inertia. The crust moment of inertia is also evaluated as a function of the neutron star mass, and predictions for mass and radii are given for different pulsars. The origin of Vela pulsar glitches is discussed, and a full crustal origin is excluded if we consider the present largest estimation of crustal entrainment. Further refinement of the present predictions requires a better estimation of the high-order isovector empirical parameters, e.g., K<SUB>sym</SUB> and Q<SUB>sym</SUB>, and a better control of the surface properties of extremely neutron rich nuclei.},

	Abstract = {The theory governing the strong nuclear force---quantum chromodynamics---predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities, hadronic nuclear matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons<SUP>1</SUP>. Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions<SUP>2,3</SUP>, it is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars<SUP>4</SUP>. By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab initio calculations in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses (M<SUB>☉</SUB>) are compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior of maximally massive stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars<SUP>5,6</SUP> with mass M ≈ 2M<SUB>☉</SUB>, the presence of quark matter is found to be linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound c<SUB>s</SUB> in strongly interacting matter. If the conformal bound c<SUB>s</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>≤1 /3 ? (ref. <SUP>7</SUP>) is not strongly violated, massive neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars and affects the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive participant.},

	Abstract = {We use a Bayesian inference analysis to explore the sensitivity of Taylor expansion parameters of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) to the neutron star dimensionless tidal deformability (Λ ) on 1- to 2-solar-mass neutron stars. A global power law dependence between tidal deformability and the compactness parameter (M /R ) is verified over this mass region. To avoid superfluous correlations between the expansion parameters, we use a correlation-free EOS model based on a recently published metamodeling approach. We find that assumptions in the prior distribution strongly influence the constraints on Λ . The Λ constraints obtained from the neutron star merger event GW170817 prefer low values of L<SUB>sym</SUB> and K<SUB>sym</SUB>, for a canonical neutron star with 1.4 solar masses. For a neutron star with mass &lt;1.6 solar masses, L<SUB>sym</SUB> and K<SUB>sym</SUB> are highly correlated with the tidal deformability. For more massive neutron stars, the tidal deformability is more strongly correlated with higher order Taylor expansion parameters.},

	Abstract = {Background: The first direct detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration (LIGO-Virgo) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 161101 (2017), 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101] has opened the brand new era of multimessenger astronomy. This historic detection has been instrumental in providing initial constraints on the tidal polarizability (or deformability) of neutron stars. In turn, the tidal polarizability---an observable highly sensitive to stellar compactness---has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and ultimately on the underlying equation of state (EOS). <P />Purpose: Besides its strong dependence on the stellar compactness, the tidal polarizability is also sensitive to the second tidal Love number k<SUB>2</SUB>. It is the main purpose of this paper to perform a detailed study of k<SUB>2</SUB> which, for a given compactness parameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the underlying equation of state. In particular, we examine the important role that the crustal component of the EOS plays in the determination of k<SUB>2</SUB>. <P />Methods: A set of realistic models of the equation of state that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei support neutron stars of two solar masses and provide a Lorentz covariant extrapolation to dense matter are used to solve both the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and the differential equations for the induced quadrupole gravitational field from which k<SUB>2</SUB> is extracted. <P />Results: Given that the tidal polarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a universal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness parameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying equation of state. Thus, besides an extraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual stellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However, we observe a strong sensitivity of the second Love number to the underlying equation of state---particularly to the contribution from the inner crust. <P />Conclusions: Although by itself the tidal polarizability cannot contribute to the determination of the mass-radius relation, future detections of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo Collaborations during the third observing run and beyond are poised to provide significant constraints on both the tidal polarizabilities and the masses of the individual stars, and thus ultimately on the mass-radius relation. Yet, subleading corrections to the tidal polarizability are encoded in the second Love number k<SUB>2</SUB>, which displays a large sensitivity to the entire---crust-plus-core---equation of state.},

	Abstract = {The binary neutron-star merger event, GW170817, has cast a new light on nuclear physics research. Using a neutron-star model that includes a crust equation of state (EoS), we calculate the properties of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The model incorporates more than 200 Skyrme energy density functionals, which describe nuclear matter properties, in the outer liquid core region of the neutron star. We find a power-law relation between the neutron-star tidal deformability, Λ, and the neutron-star radius, R. Without an explicit crust EoS, the model predicts a smaller R and the difference becomes significant for stars with large radii. To connect the neutron star properties with nuclear matter properties, we confront the predicted values for Λ against the Taylor expansion coefficients of the Skyrme interactions. There is no pronounced correlation between Skyrme parameters relevant to symmetric nuclear matter and neutron star properties. However, we find the strongest correlation between Λ and K<SUB>sym</SUB>, the curvature of the density dependence of the symmetry energy at saturation density. At twice the saturation density, our calculations show a strong correlation between Λ and total pressure, providing guidance to laboratory nucleus-nucleus collision experiments.},

	Abstract = {Is the secondary component of GW190814 the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system [R. Abbott et al., ApJ Lett., 896, L44 (2020)]? This is the central question animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star, (b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and (c) reproduce ground-state properties of finite nuclei. Yet, for the class of models explored in this work, we find that the stiffening of the equation of state required to support super-massive neutron stars is inconsistent with either constraints obtained from energetic heavy-ion collisions or from the low deformability of medium-mass stars. Thus, we speculate that the maximum neutron star mass can not be significantly higher than the existing observational limit and that the 2.6 Msun compact object is likely to be the lightest black hole ever discovered.},

	Abstract = {The historical first detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration [B. P. Abbott et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 161101 (2017), 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101] is providing fundamental new insights into the astrophysical site for the r process and on the nature of dense matter. A set of realistic models of the equation of state (EOS) that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei, support neutron stars of two solar masses, and provide a Lorentz covariant extrapolation to dense matter are used to confront its predictions against tidal polarizabilities extracted from the gravitational-wave data. Given the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave signal to the underlying EOS, limits on the tidal polarizability inferred from the observation translate into constraints on the neutron-star radius. Based on these constraints, models that predict a stiff symmetry energy, and thus large stellar radii, can be ruled out. Indeed, we deduce an upper limit on the radius of a 1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB> neutron star of R<SUB>⋆1.4</SUB>&lt;13.76 km . Given the sensitivity of the neutron-skin thickness of &lt;mml:mmultiscripts&gt;Pb 208 &lt;/mml:mmultiscripts&gt; to the symmetry energy, albeit at a lower density, we infer a corresponding upper limit of about R<SUB>skin</SUB><SUP>208</SUP>≲0.25 fm . However, if the upcoming PREX-II experiment measures a significantly thicker skin, this may be evidence of a softening of the symmetry energy at high densities---likely indicative of a phase transition in the interior of neutron stars.},

	Abstract = {The properties of neutron stars are determined by the nature of the matter that they contain. These properties can be constrained by measurements of the star's size. We obtain stringent constraints on neutron-star radii by combining multimessenger observations of the binary neutron-star merger GW170817 with nuclear theory that best accounts for density-dependent uncertainties in the equation of state. We construct equations of state constrained by chiral effective field theory and marginalize over these using the gravitational-wave observations. Combining this with the electromagnetic observations of the merger remnant that imply the presence of a short-lived hypermassive neutron star, we find that the radius of a 1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB> neutron star is R<SUB>1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB></SUB>=11.0<SUB>-0.6</SUB><SUP>+0.9</SUP>km ?

	Abstract = {The dense matter equation of state (EOS) determines neutron star (NS) structure but can be calculated reliably only up to one to two times the nuclear saturation density, using accurate many-body methods that employ nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory constrained by scattering data. In this work, we use physically motivated ansatzes for the speed of sound c <SUB> S </SUB> at high density to extend microscopic calculations of neutron-rich matter to the highest densities encountered in stable NS cores. We show how existing and expected astrophysical constraints on NS masses and radii from X-ray observations can constrain the speed of sound in the NS core. We confirm earlier expectations that c <SUB> S </SUB> is likely to violate the conformal limit of  c <SUB>S</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>≤slant  c <SUP>2</SUP>/3, possibly reaching values closer to the speed of light c at a few times the nuclear saturation density, independent of the nuclear Hamiltonian. If QCD obeys the conformal limit, we conclude that the rapid increase of c <SUB> S </SUB> required to accommodate a 2 M <SUB>☉</SUB> NS suggests a form of strongly interacting matter where a description in terms of nucleons will be unwieldy, even between one and two times the nuclear saturation density. For typical NSs with masses in the range of 1.2-1.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB>, we find radii between 10 and 14 km, and the smallest possible radius of a 1.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB> NS consistent with constraints from nuclear physics and observations is 8.4 km. We also discuss how future observations could constrain the EOS and guide theoretical developments in nuclear physics.},

	Abstract = {We present a generalized piecewise polytropic parametrization for the neutron-star equation of state using an ansatz that imposes continuity in not only pressure and energy density, but also in the speed of sound. The universe of candidate equations of state is shown to admit preferred dividing densities, determined by minimizing an error norm consisting of integral astrophysical observables. Generalized piecewise polytropes accurately reproduce astrophysical observables, such as mass, radius, tidal deformability and mode frequencies, as well as thermodynamic quantities, such as the adiabatic index. This makes the new equations of state useful for parameter estimation from gravitational waveforms. Since they are differentiable, generalized piecewise polytropes can improve pointwise convergence in numerical relativity simulations of neutron stars. Existing implementations of piecewise polytropes can easily accommodate this generalization with the same number of free parameters. Optionally, generalized piecewise polytropes can also accommodate adjustable jumps in sound speed, which allows them to capture phase transitions in neutron star matter.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the dense matter equation of state at extreme conditions is an important open problem. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars promise to solve this, with Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer poised to make precision measurements of mass and radius for several stars using the waveform modelling technique. What has been less clear, however, is how these mass-radius measurements might translate into equation of state constraints and what are the associated equation of state sensitivities. We use Bayesian inference to explore and contrast the constraints that would result from different choices for the equation of state parametrization; comparing the well-established piecewise polytropic parametrization to one based on physically motivated assumptions for the speed of sound in dense matter. We also compare the constraints resulting from Bayesian inference to those from simple compatibility cuts. We find that the choice of equation of state parametrization and particularly its prior assumptions can have a significant effect on the inferred global mass-radius relation and the equation of state constraints. Our results point to important sensitivities when inferring neutron star and dense matter properties. This applies also to inferences from gravitational wave observations.},

	Abstract = {We combine equation of state of dense matter up to twice nuclear saturation density ($n_ \rm sat =0.16\, \text fm ^ -3 $) obtained using chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and recent observations of neutron stars to gain insights about the high-density matter encountered in their cores. A key element in our study is the recent Bayesian analysis of correlated EFT truncation errors based on order-by-order calculations up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the $\chi$EFT expansion. We refine the bounds on the maximum mass imposed by causality at high densities, and provide stringent limits on the maximum and minimum radii of $\sim1.4\, \rm M _ \odot $ and $\sim2.0\, \rm M _ \odot $ stars. Including $\chi$EFT predictions from $n_ \rm sat $ to $2\,n_ \rm sat $ reduces the permitted ranges of the radius of a $1.4\, \rm M _ \odot $ star, $R_ 1.4 $, by $\sim3.5\, \text km $. If observations indicate $R_ 1.4 &lt;11.2\, \text km $, our study implies that either the squared speed of sound $c^2_ s &gt;1/2$ for densities above $2\,n_ \rm sat $, or that $\chi$EFT breaks down below $2\,n_ \rm sat $. We also comment on the nature of the secondary compact object in GW190814 with mass $\simeq 2.6\, \rm M _ \odot $, and discuss the implications of massive neutron stars $&gt;2.1 \, \rm M _ \odot \,(2.6\, \rm M _ \odot )$ in future radio and gravitational-wave searches. Some form of strongly interacting matter with $c^2_ s &gt;0.35\, (0.55)$ must be realized in the cores of such massive neutron stars. In the absence of phase transitions below $2\,n_ \rm sat $, the small tidal deformability inferred from GW170817 lends support for the relatively small pressure predicted by $\chi$EFT for the baryon density $n_ \rm B $ in the range $1-2\,n_ \rm sat $. Together they imply that the rapid stiffening required to support a high maximum mass should occur only when $n_ \rm B  \gtrsim 1.5-1.8\,n_ \rm sat $.},

	Abstract = {We explore constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron-rich matter based on microscopic calculations up to nuclear densities and observations of neutron stars. In a previous work we showed that predictions based on modern nuclear interactions derived within chiral effective field theory and the observation of two-solar-mass neutron stars result in a robust uncertainty range for neutron star radii and the EOS over a wide range of densities. In this work we extend this study, employing both the piecewise polytrope extension from Hebeler et al. as well as the speed of sound model of Greif et al., and show that moment of inertia measurements of neutron stars can significantly improve the constraints on the EOS and neutron star radii.},

	Abstract = {Metamodeling for the nucleonic equation of state (EOS), inspired from a Taylor expansion around the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter, is proposed and parameterized in terms of the empirical parameters. The present knowledge of nuclear empirical parameters is first reviewed in order to estimate their average values and associated uncertainties, and thus defining the parameter space of the metamodeling. They are divided into isoscalar and isovector types, and ordered according to their power in the density expansion. The goodness of the metamodeling is analyzed against the predictions of the original models. In addition, since no correlation among the empirical parameters is assumed a priori, all arbitrary density dependences can be explored, which might not be accessible in existing functionals. Spurious correlations due to the assumed functional form are also removed. This meta-EOS allows direct relations between the uncertainties on the empirical parameters and the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state and its derivatives, and the mapping between the two can be done with standard Bayesian techniques. A sensitivity analysis shows that the more influential empirical parameters are the isovector parameters L<SUB>sym</SUB> and K<SUB>sym</SUB>, and that laboratory constraints at supersaturation densities are essential to reduce the present uncertainties. The present metamodeling for the EOS for nuclear matter is proposed for further applications in neutron stars and supernova matter.},

	Abstract = {The question of correlations among empirical equation of state (EoS) parameters constrained by nuclear observables is addressed in a Thomas-Fermi meta-modeling approach. A recently proposed meta-modeling for the nuclear EoS in nuclear matter is augmented with a single finite size term to produce a minimal unified EoS functional able to describe the smooth part of the nuclear ground state properties. This meta-model can reproduce the predictions of a large variety of models, and interpolate continuously between them. An analytical approximation to the full Thomas-Fermi integrals is further proposed giving a fully analytical meta-model for nuclear masses. The parameter space is sampled and filtered through the constraint of nuclear mass reproduction with Bayesian statistical tools. We show that this simple analytical meta-modeling has a predictive power on masses, radii, and skins comparable to full Hartree-Fock or extended Thomas-Fermi calculations with realistic energy functionals. The covariance analysis on the posterior distribution shows that no physical correlation is present between the different EoS parameters. Concerning nuclear observables, a strong correlation between the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is observed, in agreement with previous studies.},

@article{Raithel:2018wd,
	Abstract = {Gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars were recently detected for the first time by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, in event GW170817. This detection placed an upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of the two neutron stars and tightly constrained the chirp mass of the system. We report here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal deformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in this case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly independent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and instead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star radius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to directly measure the neutron star radius. We find that the upper limit on the effective tidal deformability from GW170817 implies that the radius cannot be larger than ∼13 km, at the 90% level, independent of the assumed masses for the component stars. The result can be applied generally, to probe the stellar radii in any neutron star-neutron star merger with a measured chirp mass. The approximate mass independence disappears for neutron star-black hole mergers. Finally, we discuss a Bayesian inference of the equation of state that uses the measured chirp mass and tidal deformability from GW170817 combined with nuclear and astrophysical priors and discuss possible statistical biases in this inference.},

	Abstract = {The only messenger radiation in the Universe that one can use to statistically probe the Equation of State (EOS) of cold dense matter is that originating from the near-field vicinities of compact stars. Constraining gravitational masses and equatorial radii of rotating compact stars is a major goal for current and future telescope missions, with a primary purpose of constraining the EOS. From a Bayesian perspective, it is necessary to carefully discuss prior definition; in this context a complicating issue is that in practice there exist pathologies in the general relativistic mapping between spaces of local (interior source matter) and global (exterior space-time) parameters. In a companion paper, these issues were raised on a theoretical basis. In this study we reproduce a probability transformation procedure from the literature in order to map a joint posterior distribution of Schwarzschild gravitational masses and radii into a joint posterior distribution of EOS parameters. We demonstrate computationally that EOS parameter inferences are sensitive to the choice to define a prior on a joint space of these masses and radii, instead of on a joint space interior source matter parameters. We focus on the piecewise-polytropic EOS model, which is currently standard in the field of astrophysical dense matter study. We discuss the implications of this issue for the field.},

	Abstract = {Neutron stars and quark stars are ideal laboratories to study fundamental physics at supra nuclear densities and strong gravitational fields. Astrophysical observables, however, depend strongly on the star's internal structure, which is currently unknown due to uncertainties in the equation of state. Universal relations, however, exist among certain stellar observables that do not depend sensitively on the star's internal structure. One such set of relations is between the star's moment of inertia (I), its tidal Love number (Love) and its quadrupole moment (Q), the so-called I-Love-Q relations. Similar relations hold among the star's multipole moments, which resemble the well-known black hole no-hair theorems. Universal relations break degeneracies among astrophysical observables, leading to a variety of applications: (i) X-ray measurements of the nuclear matter equation of state, (ii) gravitational wave measurements of the intrinsic spin of inspiraling compact objects, and (iii) gravitational and astrophysical tests of General Relativity that are independent of the equation of state. We here review how the universal relations come about and all the applications that have been devised to date.},

	Abstract = {The exterior gravitational field of a slowly rotating neutron star can be characterized by its multipole moments, the first few being the neutron star mass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin. In principle, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal structure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supranuclear energy densities, all of which is usually parametrized through an equation of state. We here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love numbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations) that do not depend sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Such universality may arise for two reasons: (i) these relations depend most sensitively on the internal structure far from the core, where all realistic equations of state mostly approach each other; (ii) as the neutron star compactness increases, the I-Love-Q trio approaches that of a black hole, which does not have an internal-structure dependence. Three important consequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational astrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio would automatically provide information about the other two, even when the latter may not be observationally accessible. On a gravitational-wave front, the I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment and the neutron star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation ground-based detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to O(10)%, given a sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio detection. On a fundamental physics front, the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of general relativity in the neutron star strong field that are both theory and internal-structure independent. As an example, by combining gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, one may constrain dynamical Chern-Simons gravity in the future by more than six orders of magnitude more stringently than Solar System and table-top constraints.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of spectroscopic radius measurements of twelve neutron stars obtained during thermonuclear bursts or in quiescence. We incorporate, for the first time, a large number of systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the apparent angular sizes, Eddington fluxes, and distances, in the composition of the interstellar medium, and in the flux calibration of X-ray detectors. We also take into account the results of recent theoretical calculations of rotational effects on neutron star radii, of atmospheric effects on surface spectra, and of relativistic corrections to the Eddington critical flux. We employ Bayesian statistical frameworks to obtain neutron star radii from the spectroscopic measurements as well as to infer the equation of state from the radius measurements. Combining these with the results of experiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density and the observations of ∼ 2  M <SUB>☉ </SUB> neutron stars, we place strong and quantitative constraints on the properties of the equation of state between ≈ 2 -- 8 times the nuclear saturation density. We find that around M=1.5 M <SUB>☉ </SUB>, the preferred equation of state predicts radii between 10.1 and 11.1 km. When interpreting the pressure constraints in the context of high density equations of state based on interacting nucleons, our results suggest a relatively weak contribution of the three-body interaction potential.},

	Abstract = {The properties of matter at ultrahigh densities, low temperatures, and with a significant asymmetry between protons and neutrons can be studied exclusively through astrophysical observations of neutron stars. We show that measurements of the masses and radii of neutron stars can lead to tight constraints on the pressure of matter at three fiducial densities, from 1.85 to 7.4 times the density of nuclear saturation, in a manner that is largely model independent and that captures the key characteristics of the equation of state. We demonstrate that observations with 10% uncertainties of at least three neutron stars can lead to measurements of the pressure at these fiducial densities with an accuracy of 0.11 dex or ≃30%. Observations of three neutron stars with 5% uncertainties are sufficient to distinguish at a better than 3σ confidence level between currently proposed equations of state. In the electromagnetic spectrum, such accurate measurements will become possible for weakly magnetic neutron stars during thermonuclear flashes and in quiescence with future missions such as the International X-ray Observatory.},

@article{Newton:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Two low-mass (M &lt; 1.4 M <SUB>☉</SUB>) neutron stars, J0737-3039B and the companion to J1756-2251, show strong evidence of being formed in an ultra-stripped supernova explosion (US-SN) with a ONeMg or Fe progenitor. Using systematically generated sets of equations of state we map out the relationship between the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A, a candidate for a moment of inertia measurement within a decade, and the binding energy of the two low-mass neutron stars. This relationship, similar to the I-Love-Q relations, is more robust than a previously explored correlation between the binding energy and the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy L. We find that, if either J0737-3039B or the J1756-2251 companion were formed in a US-SN, no more than 0.06 M <SUB>☉</SUB> could have been lost from the progenitor core. Furthermore, a measurement of the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A to within 10% accuracy can discriminate between formation scenarios and, given current constraints on the predicted core mass loss, potentially rule them out. Advanced LIGO can potentially measure the neutron star tidal polarizability to equivalent accuracy which, using the I-Love-Q relations, would obtain similar constraints on the formation scenarios. Such information would help constrain important aspects of binary evolution used for population synthesis predictions of the rate of binary neutron star mergers and resulting electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. Further progress needs to be made in modeling the core-collapse process that leads to low-mass neutron stars, particularly in making robust predictions for the mass loss from the progenitor core.},

	Abstract = {We perform a systematic assessment of models for the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in the context of recent neutron star mass and radius measurements to obtain a broad picture of the structure of neutron stars. We demonstrate that currently available neutron star mass and radius measurements provide strong constraints on moments of inertia, tidal deformabilities, and crust thicknesses. A measurement of the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A with a 10% error, without any other information from observations, will constrain the EOS over a range of densities to within 50%-60%. We find tidal deformabilities between 0.6 and 6 ×10<SUP>36</SUP>g cm<SUP>2</SUP>s<SUP>2</SUP> (to 95% confidence) for M =1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB> , and any measurement which constrains this range will provide an important constraint on dense matter. The crustal fraction of the moment of inertia can be as large as 10% for M =1.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB> permitting crusts to have a large enough moment of inertia reservoir to explain glitches in the Vela pulsar even with a large amount of superfluid entrainment. Finally, due to the uncertainty in the equation of state, there is at least a 40% variation in the thickness of the crust for a fixed mass and radius, which implies that future simulations of the cooling of a neutron star crust which has been heated by accretion will need to take this variation into account.},

	Abstract = {We perform a systematic analysis of neutron star radius constraints from five quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries and examine how they depend on measurements of their distances and amounts of intervening absorbing material, as well as their assumed atmospheric compositions. We construct and calibrate to published results a semi-analytic model of the neutron star atmosphere which approximates these effects for the predicted masses and radii. Starting from mass and radius probability distributions established from hydrogen-atmosphere spectral fits of quiescent sources, we apply this model to compute alternate sets of probability distributions. We perform Bayesian analyses to estimate neutron star mass-radius curves and equation of state (EOS) parameters that best-fit each set of distributions, assuming the existence of a known low-density neutron star crustal EOS, a simple model for the high-density EOS, causality, and the observation that the neutron star maximum mass exceeds 2 M <SUB>☉</SUB>. We compute the posterior probabilities for each set of distance measurements and assumptions about absorption and composition. We find that, within the context of our assumptions and our parameterized EOS models, some absorption models are disfavored. We find that neutron stars composed of hadrons are favored relative to those with exotic matter with strong phase transitions. In addition, models in which all five stars have hydrogen atmospheres are found to be weakly disfavored. Our most likely models predict neutron star radii that are consistent with current experimental results concerning the nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction near the nuclear saturation density.},

These representations are faithful in the sense that every physical equation of state has a representation of this type and conversely every such representation satisfies the minimal thermodynamic stability criteria required of any physical equation of state. These spectral representations are also efficient, in the sense that only a few spectral coefficients are generally required to represent neutron-star equations of state quiet accurately.

This analysis assumes only that equilibrium neutron-star matter has the stress-energy tensor of an isotropic fluid with a barotropic equation of state, and that general relativity describes a neutron star's internal gravitational field.

	Abstract = {The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter has been a long-sought goal of nuclear physics. EOSs generate unique mass versus radius (M-R) relations for neutron stars, the ultra-dense remnants of stellar evolution. In this work, we determine the neutron star mass-radius relation and, based on recent observations of both transiently accreting and bursting sources, we show that the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star lies between 10.4 and 12.9 km, independent of assumptions about the composition of the core. We show, for the first time, that these constraints remain valid upon removal from our sample of the most extreme transient sources or of the entire set of bursting sources; our constraints also apply even if deconfined quark matter exists in the neutron star core. Our results significantly constrain the dense matter EOS and are furthermore consistent with constraints from both heavy-ion collisions and theoretical studies of neutron matter. We predict a relatively weak dependence of the symmetry energy on the density and a value for the neutron skin thickness of lead which is less than 0.20 fm, results that are testable in forthcoming experiments.},

@article{Steiner:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We investigate constraints on neutron star structure arising from the assumptions that neutron stars have crusts, that recent calculations of pure neutron matter limit the equation of state of neutron star matter near the nuclear saturation density, that the high-density equation of state is limited by causality and the largest high-accuracy neutron star mass measurement, and that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity. We explore the role of prior assumptions by considering two classes of equation of state models. In a first, the intermediate- and high-density behavior of the equation of state is parameterized by piecewise polytropes. In the second class, the high-density behavior of the equation of state is parameterized by piecewise continuous line segments. The smallest density at which high-density matter appears is varied in order to allow for strong phase transitions above the nuclear saturation density. We critically examine correlations among the pressure of matter, radii, maximum masses, the binding energy, the moment of inertia, and the tidal deformability, paying special attention to the sensitivity of these correlations to prior assumptions about the equation of state. It is possible to constrain the radii of 1.4 M_ ☉  neutron stars to be larger than 10km, even without consideration of additional astrophysical observations, for example, those from photospheric radius expansion bursts or quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. We are able to improve the accuracy of known correlations between the moment of inertia and compactness as well as the binding energy and compactness. We also demonstrate the existence of a correlation between the neutron star binding energy and the moment of inertia.},

	Abstract = {We determine an empirical dense matter equation of state (EOS) from a heterogeneous data set of six neutron stars: three Type-I X-ray bursters with photospheric radius expansion, studied by {\"O}zel et al., and three transient low-mass X-ray binaries. We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and radii. We introduce a parameterized EOS and use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We find significant constraints on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars, and hence on the pressure-density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry energy and the EOS near the saturation density are soft, resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11-12 km for M = 1.4 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. The predicted EOS stiffens at higher densities, however, and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum mass is relatively large, 1.9-2.2 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. Our results imply that several commonly used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a first study that uses numerical simulations to estimate the accuracy with which one can use gravitational wave observations of double neutron-star inspiral to measure parameters of the neutron-star equation of state. The simulations use the evolution and initial-data codes of Shibata and Ury{\=u} to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars, with matter described by a parametrized equation of state. Previous work suggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on the equation of state. We find, however, that greater accuracy is obtained by measuring departures from the point-particle limit of the gravitational waveform produced during the late inspiral. As the stars approach their final plunge and merger, the gravitational wave phase accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron-star compactness (the ratio of the mass of the neutron-star to its radius). We estimate that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveforms that are distinguishable from point-particle inspirals at an effective distance (the distance to an optimally oriented and located system that would produce an equivalent waveform amplitude) of 100 Mpc or less. As Lattimer and Prakash observed, neutron-star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density not far above nuclear. Our results suggest that broadband gravitational wave observations at frequencies between 500 and 1000 Hz will constrain this pressure, and we estimate the accuracy with which it can be measured. Related first estimates of radius measurability show that the radius can be determined to an accuracy of δR∼1km at 100 Mpc.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a parametrized high-density equation of state (EOS) in order to systematize the study of constraints placed by astrophysical observations on the nature of neutron-star matter. To obtain useful constraints, the number of parameters must be smaller than the number of EOS-related neutron-star properties measured, but large enough to accurately approximate the large set of candidate EOSs. We find that a parametrized EOS based on piecewise polytropes with 3 free parameters matches, to about 4% rms error, an extensive set of candidate EOSs at densities below the central density of 1.4M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars. Adding observations of more massive stars constrains the higher-density part of the EOS and requires an additional parameter. We obtain constraints on the allowed parameter space set by causality and by present and near-future astronomical observations with the least model dependence. Stringent constraints on the EOS parameter space are associated with the future measurement of the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A combined with the maximum known neutron-star mass. We also present in an appendix a more efficient algorithm than has previously been used for finding points of marginal stability and the maximum angular velocity of stable stars.},
