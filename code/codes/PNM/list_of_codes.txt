eqbm.c                                  module containing the equilibrium properties of the star used in the mode-finding code
find_f.c                                uses the frequencies of the EoSs' i-modes to get a frequency contour in the J,L plane (for the input K value)
nr_codes.c                              functions taken from numerical recipies in c (variable step size RK4, cubic splines, linear interpolation)
shoot.c                                 functions to use the shooting method to solve the differential equations, starting from the surface and core and shooting to the crust-core boundary
shoot_r.c                               a backup of shoot.c, using rd/dr for the differential equations
shoot_x.c                               a backup of shoot.c, using (1+Vtilde)d/dx for the differential equations
star_data_mcd_newton.c                  uses the outputs of the TOV for William Newton's J,L,K parameterised EoSs to find a mode close to the chosen initial trial values for Omega and z3(R*)
star_data_mcd_newton_repeat.c           similar to star_data_mcd_newton.c, but modified to be used in star.sh to loop over all of the EoSs in this set.
TOV_data_newton_2spline.c               Solves the TOV equations for the EoS with the chosen J, L and Ksym values, for the chosen mass. Uses seperate cubic splines for the core and crust to avoid problems at the discontinuous crust-core boundary. Has a section that can be un-commented to instead print out the M*(R*) graph.
TOV_data_newton_2spline_repeat.c        similar to TOV_data_newton_2spline.c, but modified to be used in star.sh to loop over all of the EoSs in this set.
find_f_JL.sh                            Loops over many K and f input values for find_f.c, and puts the resulting contours in clearly labelled files (may need to make some changes in find_f.c, see comments in find_f.c)
find_f_JK.sh                            Loops over many L and f input values for find_f.c, and puts the resulting contours in clearly labelled files (may need to make some changes in find_f.c, see comments in find_f.c)
find_f_LK.sh                            Loops over many J and f input values for find_f.c, and puts the resulting contours in clearly labelled files (may need to make some changes in find_f.c, see comments in find_f.c)
find_f.sh                               A backup of find_f_JL.sh,find_f_JK.sh, and find_f_LK.sh
star.sh                                 Loops over the EoSs in this set to find the i-mode frequency for each of them (for the chosen mass) (the output should be diverted into a text file (./star.sh > output.txt)) (the commented out lines should be used if your EoSs have a header or go below rho=10^4 g/cm^3, as these will mess up the TOV and mode-finding codes)
