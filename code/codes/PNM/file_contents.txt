contours_a0_b12/         Contains files with interpolated L and Ksym values that, for the chosen J value, result in i-modes with the chosen frequency. File naming convention is  ' f100_J32.0.txt ', where the number after 'f' is the chosen frequency, and the number after 'J' is the chosen J value. The values in the files are J, L, Ksym. The files with 'chirp1.2_pdf' and 'chirp1.2_mdf' in their names contain the same, but for f+df and f-df, where f is the chosen frequency and df is the spread due to the resonance window (for chirp mass = 1.2).

contours_J_a0/           Similar to contours_a0_b12, but where the J, L and Ksym values are interpolated so that, for the chosen b12 value, the i-modes has the chosen frequency. (for definition of a0 and b12, see 'Newton W. G., Crocombe G., 2020, arXiv e-prints, p. arXiv:2008.00042')

contours_J_b12/          Similar to contours_a0_b12, but where the J, L and Ksym values are interpolated so that, for the chosen a0 value, the i-modes has the chosen frequency. (for definition of a0 and b12, see 'Newton W. G., Crocombe G., 2020, arXiv e-prints, p. arXiv:2008.00042')

TO REPRODUCE THE 3D PLOT IN OUR PAPER: plot the files in 'contours_a0_b12/', 'contours_J_a0/' and 'contours_J_b12/' that have the same chosen frequency value to get a surface for that frequency. (ie: contours_a0_b12/f120_J*.txt, contours_J_a0/f120_b12_*.txt, contours_J_b12/f120_a0_*.txt for the 120Hz surface) (All of the files in these directories have columns: J, L, Ksym. Therefore, it should be simple to plot them together.)

EoSs/                    Contains the grid of equations of state for our 'PNM' J,L,Ksym ranges.

planes/                  Contains the results of some simple linear interpolation to get planes in J,L,Ksym for several different frequencies. Should be simple to plot and view in gnuplot. (These are old and very simple, use the files in the contours_*/ directories instead)

shear_speed/             Contains the codes used and results obtained while investigating the relationship between the shear speed and the frequency and symmetry energy parameters

TOV_MR/                  Contains the mass-radius relationship for some of our EoSs (J, L, Ksym values are in the file names): NS radius, NS mass
