grid_frequencysurface.py (PNM_frequencysurface.py in the PNM directory)
  Python code to produce the 3D plots of constant i-mode frequency surfaces in J,L,Ksym. The code begins with the variables 'theta' and 'phi', which can be changed to alter the viewing angle of these plots.

eqbm.c
  module containing the equilibrium properties of the star used in the mode-finding code

find_f.c
  uses the frequencies of the EoSs' i-modes to get a frequency contour in the J,L plane (for the input K value)

nr_codes.c
  functions taken from numerical recipies in c (variable step size RK4, cubic splines, linear interpolation)

shoot.c
  functions to use the shooting method to solve the differential equations, starting from the surface and core and shooting to the crust-core boundary

shoot_r.c
  a backup of shoot.c, using rd/dr for the differential equations

shoot_x.c
  a backup of shoot.c, using (1+Vtilde)d/dx for the differential equations (this is equivilent to using rd/dr, but uses the same variables as the rest of the differential equation)

star_data_mcd_newton.c
  uses the outputs of the TOV for William Newton's J,L,K parameterised EoSs to find a mode close to the chosen initial trial values for Omega and z3(R*)

star_data_mcd_newton_repeat.c
  similar to star_data_mcd_newton.c, but modified to be used in star.sh to loop over all of the EoSs in this set.

TOV_data_newton_2spline.c
  Solves the TOV equations for the EoS with the chosen J, L and Ksym values, for the chosen mass. Uses seperate cubic splines for the core and crust to avoid problems at the discontinuous crust-core boundary. Has a section that can be un-commented to instead produce the M*(R*) plot for this EoS.

TOV_data_newton_2spline_repeat.c
  similar to TOV_data_newton_2spline.c, but modified to be used in star.sh to loop over all of the EoSs in this set.

find_f_JL.sh (find_f_JK.sh) [find_f_LK.sh]
  Loops over many K and f (L and f) [J and f] input values for find_f.c, and puts the resulting contours in clearly labelled files (some changes are needed in find_f.c change between these 3 different scripts, see the comments in that code)

find_f.sh
  A backup of find_f_JL.sh, find_f_JK.sh, and find_f_LK.sh

f_Rvals.sh
  Loops over the TOV and mode-finding codes to get the frequency, crust-core radius and total radius for many different stellar masses

star.sh
  Loops over the EoSs in this set to find the i-mode frequency for each of them (for the chosen mass) (the output is printed in the terminal)
