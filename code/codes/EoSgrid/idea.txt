I've worked out that per unit of change in the shear modulus, the frequency changes around 3 times more than it does per unit of change in the pressure (ie, for J=30,L=50,K=-80, a change of 5e+29 in the shear modulus changes the frequency by around 3.0 Hz, and a change of 5e+29 in the pressure changes the frequency by only around 1.3 Hz). However, around the crust-core transition the pressure is approximately 3 orders of magnitude larger than the shear modulus. Therefore, when changing the symmetry energy parameters, the change in the pressure is much greater than the change in the shear modulus, and therefore the change in pressure has a greater contribution the the change in frequency. In other words, the impact of the shear modulus is greater than that of the pressure, but the pressure changes a lot more and therefore has a greater impact on the frequency.
