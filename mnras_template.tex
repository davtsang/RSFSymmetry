\section{Introduction}
\hspace{\parindent}Neutron stars consist of extremely dense matter, the study of which is important for our understanding of nuclear physics. To investigate the internal structure of these stars we must find ways to probe them using observational phenomena. Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) \citet{d2015short} are one such phenomena that, while their origins are uncertain, likely originate from the merging of binary neutron stars \citet{eichler1989nucleosynthesis}. These bursts are characterised by a large peak in the gamma-ray count that lasts for $\sim 2$ second or less. Around $\sim3-10$\% of sGRBs are preceded by a 'precursor' flare \citep{zhong2019precursors,troja2010precursors}. Precursor flares can be identified as a lower, separate peak in the gamma-ray count a short time ($\sim 0.1-1.0$ s) before the main peak \citet{zhong2019precursors}. In this paper we will investigate the constraints that can be applied to nuclear physics parameters by one possible cause of precursors: resonant shattering flares.
%mention orphan flares?

Recent multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers have provided insight into the origin of sGRBs. In particular, the detection of the gravitational wave signals GW170817 \citet{abbott2017merger} and GW190425 \citet{abbott2020gw190425} (which are thought to originate from mergers involving neutron stars) has provided a new angle from which to investigate neutron stars. Here, we propose to use multimessenger coincident timing of the gravitational-wave chirp and a resonant shattering flare, in order to determine the frequency of a particular neutron star oscillation mode and constrain fundamental parameters in nuclear physics.

Within a star the bulk motion of matter can be described as a linear combination of an infinite set of normal modes \citet{smeyers2011linear}. Each mode oscillates at a particular frequency, at which it obeys the boundary conditions for the displacement of matter at the surface, centre and (for neutron stars) the crust-core boundary of the star. These oscillations can be driven by time varying external gravitational fields, such as that of a binary partner. The frequencies and radial profiles of the modes are strongly dependant on the internal structure of the star, with different modes being dependant on different properties, such as pressure or shear forces.


%define core and crust (and ocean)? or assume reader knows what they are. Might be useful for explaining that the crust has a limit to how much strain it can take.




\subsection{Resonant Shattering Flares}
\hspace{\parindent}During the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of neutron star binaries, the normal modes of a neutron star can become excited by resonant tidal interactions with its binary partner. As the stars' orbits get smaller, the frequency of the orbit (and hence the gravitational wave frequency) increases. When the orbital frequency sweeps through the appropriate resonance windows, the normal modes are excited, causing the oscillations to rapidly grow in magnitude \citep{tsang2012resonant, tsang2013shattering, lai1994resonant}.

If a resonant mode is sufficiently large to cause a crustal deformation that exceeds the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, the crust will fracture, depositing seismic energy into the crust. One such mode is the quadrupole crust-core interface (i) mode. This mode is caused by the discontinuity in bulk material properties between the crust and core and has a strong overlap with the tidal field \citet{tsang2012resonant}, making it a good candidate as energy is quickly deposited into it at resonance. The fractures and seismic waves continue to be driven until the crust reaches its elastic limit, causing it to shatter, scattering the seismic waves to high frequencies that are able to couple to the star's magnetic field, depositing energy into the magnetosphere and sparking a pair-photon fireball. Multiple colliding shells may be emitted over the course of the resonance window, leading to a single non-thermal burst with a duration of the resonance time, and the maximum luminosity determined by the surface magnetic field strength. % references?  %define overlap before this?

For sufficiently strong surface magnetic field, these Resonant Shattering Flares (RSFs) can be detectable well beyond the Advanced LIGO horizon. Coincident timing of the RSF prompt emission and the gravitational-wave chirp provides a precise measurement of the resonant mode frequency. Therefore, by using a nuclear model to calculate the i-mode frequency, the parameters of that model could be restricted to ranges which results in mode frequencies that closely match the observed gravitational wave frequency during the RSF. 

In this paper, we will explore the implications of a coincident multi-messenger detection of an RSF on constraining fundamental nuclear physics parameters. In particular we will explore the relationship between the i-mode frequency, neutron star structure, and the nuclear symmetry energy parameters that determines the behaviour of matter near nuclear saturation density. 







\subsection{Nuclear Symmetry Energy and Neutron Star Structure}
\hspace{\parindent}The mode frequencies are dependent on the neutron star equation of state (EoS), the relationship between the energy density and pressure within the star. At low densities the EoS can be accurately calculated by using the properties of experimentally measured nuclei \citet{baym1971ground}. However, at the extreme densities found in neutron stars we must rely on nuclear models to calculate the EoS, with different models giving significantly different EoSs. In order to reproduce physical results, these models are parameterised with various nuclear properties, such as the symmetry energy parameters. The nuclear symmetry energy is the average energy per nucleon required to convert symmetric nuclear matter (Z=N) into pure neutron matter (Z=0). At nuclear saturation density (the density of nucleons in a nucleus) the first three symmetry energy parameters are: the symmetry energy
\begin{align}
J=E_{\rm sym}(n_0),    
\label{eq:sym_J}
\end{align}
\noindent its first derivative 
\begin{align}
L=3n_0\frac{\partial E_{\rm sym}(n_b)}{\partial n_b}\biggr\rvert_{n_b=n_0},  
\label{eq:sym_L}
\end{align}
\noindent and its second derivative
\begin{align}
K_{\rm sym}=9n_0^2\frac{\partial^2 E_{\rm sym}(n_b)}{\partial n_b^2}\biggr\rvert_{n_b=n_0},
\label{eq:sym_K}
\end{align}
\noindent where $n_0\approx 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$ is the nuclear saturation density and $n_b$ is the baryon density.

\noindent The magnitude of the symmetry energy controls the proton fraction at that density. The slope $L$ correlates with the pressure at that density, and $K_{\rm sym}$ controls the derivative of pressure, thus determining how rapidly the pressure increases as one moves into the core, while also playing an important role determining the stability of matter and its compressibility.

To investigate the nuclear symmetry energy parameters we generated a set of EOSs spanning a reasonable range of values for $J$ ,$L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$. We use an extended Skyrme mean field model for the uniform matter EoS. Three parameters of the model affect only the pure neutron matter EoS, and can be written in terms of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$; we are therefore able to generate sets of EoSs parameterized by $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$.

To calculate the crust composition and EOS, we use the same Skyrme models in a compressible liquid drop model (CLDM). The model assumes a lattice consisting a single species of nucleus immersed in a neutron gas in a repeating unit cell (the Wigner-Seitz approximation). In particular, the model allows us to calculate the shear modulus and adiabatic index as a function of baryon density $n_{\rm b}$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:shear_mod}
	\mu = 0.1106 \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3} A^{-4/3} n_{\rm b}^{4/3} (1-X_{\rm n})^{4/3} (Ze)^2,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\rm F} = \frac{n_{\rm b}}{P} \frac{dP}{dn_{\rm b}}\bigg|_{\rm constant \; composition} =  \frac{n_{\rm b}}{P} \bigg[\frac{dP_n}{dn_{\rm n}} +  x \frac{dP_e}{dn_{\rm e}}  \bigg]
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A,Z$ is the number of nucleons and protons  respectively in the nucleus, $X_n$ is the volume fraction of the neutron gas, and $x$ the average proton fraction.

By calculating the mode frequencies for these EoSs we are able to find the relationship between the symmetry energy parameters and the gravitational wave frequency at which an RSF occurs.







\section{Parameterised Neutron Star Equation of State and Composition}


The EOS of the core is uncertain; The Skyrme model is designed to describe nuclear interactions at around nuclear saturation density, and the increasing importance of relativistic effects,  the possible appearance of hyperons at supersaturation density and a quark matter inner core remove the physical motivation for using it at higher densities. In order to systematically explore the effects of the symmetry energy at around saturation density, we also need to be able to control the high-density equation of state. In order to do this, we fit two polytropes at supersaturation densities; one at a density of $n_1$=1.5$n_{\rm s}$ and one at $n_2$=2.7$n_{\rm s}$. Then we have density regions


\begin{align}
\nonumber P_{\rm Skyrme} & \;\;\;\;\; n<1.5n_{\rm s}  \\
\nonumber P_1 = K_1 n^{\Gamma_1}  & \;\;\;\;\;n_1 <n<n_2  \\
P_2 = K_2 n^{\Gamma_2} & \;\;\;\;\;  n_2 < n
\end{align}

Here continuity determines the constants $K_1$ and $K_2$:

\begin{align}\nonumber
K_1 n_1^{\Gamma_1} &= P_{\rm Skyrme}   \\
K_2 n_2^{\Gamma_2} &= K_1 n_1^{\Gamma_1} 
\end{align}

The energy density in the three density regions is obtained by integrating the first law of thermodynamics:

\begin{align}\nonumber
\epsilon_{\rm Skyrme} & \;\;\;\;\; n<1.5n_{\rm s} \\
\nonumber \epsilon_1 = (1+a_1)n + \frac{K_1 n^{\Gamma_1}}{\Gamma_1 -1}  & \;\;\;\;\;n_1 <n<n_2 \\
\epsilon_2 = (1+a_2)n + \frac{K_2 n^{\Gamma_2}}{\Gamma_2 -1} & \;\;\;\;\;  n_2 < n
\end{align}

\noindent where the constants of integration $a_1$ and $a_2$ are given by

\begin{align}
a_i = \frac{\epsilon_{\rm Skryme} (n_i)}{n_i} - \frac{K_i n^{\Gamma_i - 1}}{\Gamma_i -1} - 1
\end{align}

\noindent for $i$=\{1,2\}.

The speed of sound is 

\begin{equation}
\frac{c_{\rm s,i}(n)}{c} = \bigg( \frac{\Gamma_i P(n)}{P + \epsilon}\bigg)^{1/2}
\end{equation}

In the eventuality that the EOS becomes acausal at a given density $n_{\rm acausal}$, we transition to a causal EOS:

\begin{equation}
P_{\rm causal} = \epsilon = bn^{1/3} \;\;\;\;\;  n_{\rm acausal} < n
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\epsilon$ is the energy density and $b$ is a constant given by

\begin{equation}
b = \frac{1+a}{n_{\rm acausal}} + K \frac{n_{\rm acausal}^{\Gamma-2}}{\Gamma-1}
\end{equation}

Each equation of state generated is characterized by 5 parameters: the three symmetry energy coefficients $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ for the Skyrme-EOS, and the polytropic parameters $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. $\Gamma_2$, which controls the high density part of the EOS, can be tuned to give a desired maximum mass; $\Gamma_1$, which controls the EOS at intermediate densities in the core can be tuned to give a particular moment of inertia of a 1.4$M_{\odot}$ star $I_{1.4}$ while keeping the other parameters fixed. We can thus parametrize each EOS by $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, $I_{1.4}$, $M_{\rm max}$.

In this work, since we are focusing on a crustal phenomena, we explore the degrees of freedom in the crust and outer core EOS $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ while keeping the high density degrees of freedom $I_{1.4}$, $M_{\rm max}$ fixed. We choose to fix $M_{\rm max}$ at 2.2$M_{\odot}$, comfortably above the maximum accurately measured pulsar mass and consistent with maximum masses inferred from modeling of the binary neutron star merger resulting in GW170817. For $I_{1.4}$, for each EOS we take the average of the maximum and minimum possible value of the moment of inertia of a 1.4$M_{\odot}$ star.

\section{Calculation of the Normal Modes}
\hspace{\parindent}We calculate the frequencies and radial/transverse displacements of the modes of a neutron star by linearly perturbing the equations defining the equilibrium state of neutron star matter. We assume that the binary lifetime is much larger than the spin-down and cooling times of the individual neutron stars, and so we may ignore rotation and high-temperature effects. We will also assume that the frequencies of the modes that we are interested in ($\sim 10 - 100$ Hz) result in oscillations that are significantly faster than the beta-equilibrium timescale. Therefore, weak-interactions do not have time to change the composition of a displaced mass element to more closely match the local composition.%refer to modes as 'modes' or 'eigenmodes'?





\subsection{Basic Equations}
\hspace{\parindent}To construct a 2-component neutron star model (consisting of a solid crust and a fluid core) we follow \citet{mcdermott1988nonradial}, beginning with the equations for mass continuity, momentum conservation, and Poisson's equation:%reword this so we don't get 'equation for Poisson's equation'?
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho v)=0,
\label{eq:continuity_eqn}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=(v\cdot \nabla)v=\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla\cdot\sigma-\nabla\Phi,
\label{eq:momentum_eqn}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\nabla^2\Phi=4\pi G\rho,
\label{eq:Poisson_eqn}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\rho$ is the energy density, $v$ is the velocity of the matter, $\sigma$ is the stress tensor, and $\Phi$ is the gravitational potential. Combining the linear perturbations of these equations (and taking the Cowling approximation by ignoring perturbations of the gravitational potential \citet{cowling1941non}), we obtain the wave equation
\begin{align}\nonumber
&&\omega^2u=-\nabla\left(\frac{\Gamma_1 p}{\rho}\nabla\cdot u\right)-\nabla\left(\frac{1}{\rho}u\cdot\nabla p\right)-\hat{r}A\frac{\Gamma_1 p}{\rho}\nabla\cdot u\\\nonumber
&&+\frac{1}{\rho}\biggr(\nabla\left(\frac{2}{3}\mu\nabla\cdot u\right)-\left(\nabla\mu\cdot\nabla\right)u-\nabla\left(u\cdot\nabla\mu\right)\\
&&+\left(u\cdot\nabla\right)\nabla\mu-\mu\left(\nabla^2 u+\nabla\left(\nabla\cdot u\right)\right)\biggr),
\label{eq:wave_eqn}
\end{align}
where $u(x,t)$ is the Lagrangian displacement (the displacement of the mass element that is located at $x$ when $t=0$),%remove definition of Lag. disp. ?
\begin{align}
A=\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{dr}-\frac{1}{\Gamma_1P}\frac{dP}{dr}
\label{eq:schwartz_descrim}
\end{align}
\noindent is the Schwarzschild discriminant, and
\begin{align}
\Gamma_1=\left(\frac{\partial\ln(P)}{\partial\ln(\rho)}\right)_s
\label{eq:adiabatic_index}
\end{align}
\noindent is the adiabatic index when the composition of the star is frozen. The non-diagonal terms of the stress tensor are given by $\sigma_{ij} = \mu \nabla_i u_j$, assuming the isotropic shear modulus $\mu$ given by \citet{strohmayer1991shear}
\begin{align}
\mu=\frac{0.1194}{1+17810\left(\frac{ak_bT}{\left(Ze\right)^2}\right)^2}\frac{n_i\left(Ze\right)^2}{a},
\label{eq:mu_1991}
\end{align}
\noindent where $T$ is the temperature, $n_i$ is the ion density, $Z$ is the proton number of the nuclei, and 
\begin{align}
a=\left(\frac{3}{4\pi n_i}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
\label{eq:mu_1991_a}
\end{align}
\noindent Taking the perturbations to have time dependence of the form $e^{i\omega t}$, where $\omega$ is the mode frequency, we have 
\begin{align}
u(x,t)=\xi(x)e^{i\omega t}.
\label{eq:time_seperation}
\end{align}
\noindent In spherical coordinates this can be further separated into radial and transverse components:
\begin{align}
\xi_r=U(r)Y_{lm},\;\;\;\xi_{\theta}=V(r)\frac{\partial Y_{lm}}{\partial\theta},\;\;\;\xi_{\phi}=\frac{V(r)}{sin(\theta)}\frac{\partial Y_{lm}}{\partial\phi},
\label{eq:xi_seperation}
\end{align}
\noindent where $U(r)$ is the radial displacement, $V(r)$ is the transverse displacement, and $Y_{lm}$ are the spherical harmonics.

By using the separation of variables given in equations \ref{eq:time_seperation} and \ref{eq:xi_seperation}, the wave equation can be rewritten in terms of $U$ and $V$:\footnote{The version of equation \ref{eq:Ueqn} in \citet{mcdermott1988nonradial} has a typographical error.} 
\begin{align}\nonumber
&&\rho\omega^2U=\rho\frac{d\hat{\chi}}{dr}-A\Gamma_1 p\hat{\alpha}-\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{1}{3}\mu\hat{\alpha}\right)+\frac{d\mu}{dr}\left(\hat{\alpha}-2\frac{dU}{dr}\right)\\
&&-\mu\left(\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left( r^2\frac{dU}{dr}\right)-\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}U+\frac{2\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}V-\frac{2}{r^2}U\right),

&&\rho\omega^2V=\rho\frac{\hat{\chi}}{r}-\frac{1}{3}\frac{\mu\hat{\alpha}}{r}-\frac{d\mu}{dr}\left(\frac{dV}{dr}-\frac{V}{r}+\frac{U}{r}\right)\\
&&-\mu\left(\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dV}{dr}\right)-\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}V+\frac{2}{r^2}U\right),

% \label{eq:Phihat_eqn}
% \end{align}
\noindent where:\footnote{The version of equation \ref{eq:chihat} in \citet{mcdermott1988nonradial} has a typographical error.}

In this work we have applied Newtonian perturbations to a relativistic equilibrium stellar structure, resulting in a hybrid model. In order for this model to be usable, the modes must be orthogonal such that any perturbation can be expressed as a unique linear combination of the modes. The eigenfunction and eigenvalue of any mode can be defined in relation to the oscillation operator, $\mathcal{H}$, as shown by \citet{reisenegger1994multipole}:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}\xi=-\omega^2\xi.
\end{align}
\noindent Newtonian perturbations will only result in orthogonal modes if $\mathcal{H}$ is hermitian with respect to the inner product of two vector fields (any two displacements of matter within the star), ie:
\begin{align}
\int_*\rho_0(r)\zeta^*(x)\cdot\mathcal{H}\Psi(x)d^3x=\int_*\rho_0(r)\mathcal{H}\zeta^*(x)\cdot\Psi(x)d^3x.
\end{align}
\noindent For a Newtonian stellar model, the oscillation operator is hermitian, and therefore Newtonian perturbations can be applied to it to obtain orthogonal modes. 

For a relativistic stellar model, the oscillation operator is not hermitian. However, this does not pose a problem for relativistic perturbations because their eigenfrequencies are complex numbers, with the imaginary component arising from the damping of the mode due to the emission of gravitational waves. This imaginary component cancels out the deviation from orthogonality that arises from $\mathcal{H}$ not being Hermitian, and so relativistic perturbations can be applied to a relativistic stellar model to obtain orthogonal modes.

Our hybrid model can cause problems, because the stellar model does not give a Hermitian oscillation operator and the eigenfrequencies of Newtonian oscillations do not have the imaginary component required to cancel out the modes' deviation from orthogonality. To fix this, we follow the calculations of \citet{reisenegger1994multipole} and artificially force the oscillation operator to be Hermitian by defining the acceleration due to gravity within the star as
\begin{align}
g=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}.  %SHOULD THERE BE A - SIGN HERE?
\label{eq:rel_grav}
\end{align}
\noindent This form for the gravity makes the oscillation operator hermitian within the relativistic model, and therefore we can apply Newtonian perturbations to this modified relativistic star to obtain orthogonal modes. The change to the gravity somewhat changes the properties of the modes, but only to a small degree.















% For the fluid core of a neutron star, equations \ref{eq:Ueqn}-\ref{eq:chihat} are further simplified because in a fluid the shear modulus must be zero. By using $\mu=0$, and be rewriting $U$ and $V$ as the dimensionless variables

%Explain how we determine where Rcc is?

At the boundary between the solid crust and the fluid core, there are three jump conditions that must be satisfied:\footnote{The version of the left-hand side of equation \ref{eq:jump2} in \citet{mcdermott1988nonradial} has a typographical error.}
\begin{align}
U\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{+}}=U\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{-}},
\label{eq:jump1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{p}\left(\lambda\hat{\alpha}+2\mu\frac{dU}{dr}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{+}}=\tilde{V}\left(\frac{U}{r}-\frac{\omega^2V}{g}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{-}},
\label{eq:jump2}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\frac{\mu}{p}\left(\frac{dV}{dr}-\frac{V}{r}+\frac{U}{r}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{+}}=0,
\label{eq:jump3}
\end{align}
\noindent where 
\begin{align}
\tilde{V}=-\frac{d\ln\left(P\right)}{d\ln\left(r\right)}=\frac{\rho g r}{p},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\lambda=\Gamma_1P-\frac{2}{3}\mu
\end{align}
\noindent is the Lam\'e coefficient, 
\begin{align}
M_r=4\pi\int^r_0 r'^2\rho(r')dr'
\label{eq:mass_r}
\end{align}
\noindent is the mass contained within radius $r$, and $r=R_{\rm cc}^{+}$ ($r=R_{\rm cc}^{-}$) indicates that the value is evaluated at the boundary when approached from the crust (core) of the star. The three conditions require different properties to be continuous across the crust-core boundary. The first is for the radial displacement, the second is for the pressure, and the third is for the traction (which must be zero in the fluid core). The first two jump conditions can be combined in order to cancel out the arbitrary magnitude of $U$ and $V$ (which is different in the crust and the core), giving us
\begin{align}
\frac{r}{p}\frac{\left(\lambda\hat{\alpha}+2\mu\frac{dU}{dr}\right)}{U}\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{+}}=\tilde{V}\left(1-\frac{\sigma^2r}{g}\frac{V}{U}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{\rm cc}^{-}}.
\label{eq:jump2/1}
\end{align}
\noindent This means that there are two boundary conditions, equations \ref{eq:jump3} and \ref{eq:jump2/1}, and two eigenvalues, $\Omega$ and $V(R_*)$.

%Note, we skip the surface ocean, so must immediately apply the jump conditions to the surface boundary condition
Every eigenmode must satisfy the boundary conditions at the centre and surface of the star. The conditions at the surface are based on the requirement that the Lagrangian pressure perturbation goes to zero at the surface:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{p}\left(\lambda\hat{\alpha}+2\mu\frac{dU}{dr}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{*}}=\tilde{V}\left(\frac{\tilde{V}-c_1\Omega^2-4+\tilde{U}}{\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{c_1\Omega^2}-\tilde{V}}+1\right)\frac{U}{r}\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{*}},
\label{eq:surface_boundary_modified_1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\frac{\mu}{p}\left(\frac{dV}{dr}-\frac{V}{r}+\frac{U}{r}\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=R_{*}}=0,
\label{eq:surface_boundary_modified_2}
\end{align}
\noindent where every quantity is evaluated at the surface of the star ($r=R_*$), and 
\begin{align}\nonumber
\tilde{U}=\frac{d\ln\left(M_r\right)}{d\ln\left(r\right)}=4\pi r^2\rho\frac{r}{M_r},\;\;\;c_1=\left(\frac{r}{R_*}\right)^3\frac{M_*}{M_r},\;\;\;\Omega^2=\frac{\omega^2R_*^3}{GM_*}
\end{align}
\noindent are equilibrium properties of the star. The condition at the centre of the star follows from the requirement that $U$ and $V$ be regular there:
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{c_1\Omega^2}{l}U-\frac{\sigma^2r}{g}V\right)\biggr\rvert_{r=0}=0,
\label{eq:core_condition}
\end{align}
\noindent where every quantity is evaluated at the centre of the star ($r=0$).


We numerically solve for the eigenvalues by adjusting the trial eigenvalues and repeatedly solving equations \ref{eq:Ueqn} and \ref{eq:Veqn} until the jump conditions were satisfied, indicating that a mode had been found. Figure \ref{fig:trace_minima} shows, for a small range of each eigenvalue, the eigenvalues at which each of the jump conditions are satisfied for a specific EoS, with modes being located at the places where both conditions are satisfied.
%probably should trim this, it's a bit to much numerical information

\caption{The eigenvalues that satisfy the jump conditions at the crust-core boundary, showing the location of two modes (the interface and fundamental modes). This figure uses the EoS parameterised by $J=30$ MeV, $L=50$ MeV, and $K_{\rm sym}=-80$ MeV.}
\label{fig:trace_minima}
\end{figure}








\subsection{The Crust-Core Interface Mode}
\hspace{\parindent}Figure \ref{fig:2i_mode} shows the interface mode for an EoS in the middle of our symmetry energy parameter ranges. This mode has a distinctive peak in its radial displacement at the crust-core boundary, which is what we expect because the i-mode is caused by the discontinuity between the crust and core. For this EoS, its eigenvalues are $f=134.3$ Hz and $V(R_*)=-7.72$ (as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:trace_minima}). The transverse displacement in the core is small, while in the crust it discontinuously jumps to become large. This makes the i-mode a good candidate for an RSF because more of its energy will go into deforming the crust, helping it to reach the breaking strain faster.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,angle=0]{2i2_30_50_-80.png}
\caption{The $l=2$ i-mode for the EoS parameterised by $J=30$ MeV, $L=50$ MeV, and $K_{\rm sym}=-80$ MeV. $V(r)$ has been reduced by an order of magnitude so that it can be plotted alongside $U(r)$.}
\label{fig:2i_mode}
\end{figure}

% The i-mode has a strong dependence on the shear modulus in the crust, and more specifically at the crust-core transition. We investigated this dependence by considering a shear modulus artificially scaled by 
% \begin{align}
% \tilde{\mu} = B \mu,
% \end{align}
% \noindent where the constant $B$ was varied to determine its impact on the i-mode. Figure \ref{fig:mu_B} shows the relationship between $B$ and the i-mode frequency. The constant which controls the scaling due to temperature was not varied because we have assumed that the temperature of the star is low and therefore this constant would need to be very large to have a noticeable impact on the shear modulus. Modifying the shear modulus by varying $B$ is very artificial because it is strongly linked to the other equilibrium properties of the star, and so they would also have to be changed to realistically modify the shear modulus. Therefore, changing the shear modulus in this way should only be seen as a rough guide to its impact on the frequency.

\section{Results}
\subsection{The impact of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ on stellar structure}\label{sec:stellar_structure}
\hspace{\parindent}Figure \ref{fig:MR_Jvals} shows the relationship between the total neutron star mass and the stellar radius and crust-core transition radius, and how the relationship changes as $J$ is varied. Figures \ref{fig:MR_Lvals} and \ref{fig:MR_Kvals} show the same, but with varying $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ values. These figures show how the bulk properties of the star are affected by the symmetry energy parameters. $J$ has very little impact on the crust-core transition radius and a small impact on the total radius, whereas variations in $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ cause larger changes in both the crust-core and total radii. For many different types of mode, the frequency is dependant on both the stellar radius and the location of the crust-core transition, and therefore, if we only consider these three plots, we would expect mode frequencies to vary with $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ more than with $J$. However, we must also consider the impact of the symmetry energy parameters on the restoring forces that cause the modes to oscillate. For the i-mode, the restoring forces are dominated by shear forces, and therefore we would expect the impact of the symmetry energy parameters on the i-mode frequency to be closely related to their impact on the shear speed $c_t=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho}}$. Figures \ref{fig:Mct_Jvals}, \ref{fig:Mct_Lvals} and \ref{fig:Mct_Kvals} show the impact of the stellar mass and the symmetry energy parameters on the density-weighted average of the shear speed. These figures show that $J$ and $L$ have larger impacts on the average shear speed than $K_{\rm sym}$, and that all three of the symmetry energy parameters cause large changes in the shear speed.
%^Split up this large paragraph?

By studying the trends of figures \ref{fig:MR_Jvals}-\ref{fig:Mct_Kvals} we can see that the symmetry energy parameters have a much larger impact on the shear speed than on the total stellar radius and the crust-core transition location, and therefore we can predict that the i-mode frequency's relationship to the symmetry energy parameters will be similar to their relationship with the average shear speed, that is to say that $L$ will have the greatest impact on the frequency, then $J$, and finally $K_{\rm sym}$ will have the weakest impact.

%^something about how mass relates to the i-mode frequency / relationship between i-mode frequency and the symmetry energy parameters (at low mass, the impact of J on M(R) is larger -> J has a larger impact on f at low mass?)

\subsection{Interface Mode dependence on Nuclear Parameters}
\label{sec:grid}
\hspace{\parindent}For the remainder of this paper, unless otherwise stated, we focus our results on neutron stars with mass $1.4M_{\odot}$. We explored three different ranges of symmetry energy parameters and the EoSs that are produced. In Section \ref{subsec4_1_1}, we conservatively choose a weakly-constrained (large) range for the symmetry energy parameters, $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, in order to avoid tying our results to those of previous works. In Section \ref{subsec4_1_2}, the ranges of the symmetry energy parameters are chosen to match the constraints determined by pure neutron matter theory, as this is the most relevant constraint for neutron star matter, which is extremely neutron rich. Finally, in Section \ref{subsec4_1_3}, we take $K_{\rm sym}$ to be a particular function of $J$ and $L$, in order to compare with previous works that have only allowed the first two symmetry energy parameters to vary, such as \citet{steiner2012connecting} and \citet{tsang2009constraints} [ARE THESE CITATIONS CORRECT]. WILL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE CHOOSE MATCHING MSL0 AND WHY MSL0 WAS CHOSEN.
%^CITE PREVIOUS WORKS THAT ONLY VARY J AND L HERE, OR JUST IN THE MSL0 SUBSECTION?







\subsubsection{Weakly constrained $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ values}\label{subsec4_1_1}
\hspace{\parindent}The ranges of the symmetry energy parameters for our most conservative range of EoSs were $25\leq J\leq 35$ MeV, $20\leq L\leq 80$ MeV, and $-200\leq K_{\rm sym}\leq 40$ MeV. These ranges were chosen to confidently cover the ranges predicted by other works \citep{liu2010nuclear,tsang2012constraints,lattimer2013constraining}, and so they are extremely conservative. After constructing a grid of stellar models, we calculated the $\ell = 2$ i-mode frequency for each of these stars, and then interpolated between them to find surfaces of constant frequency in the $J$,$L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space, shown in figure \ref{fig:grid_J_L_K}.




\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,angle=0]{grid_J_L_K.png}
\caption{Surfaces of constant i-mode frequency in the $J$,$L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space for a wide range of symmetry energy parameter values.}
\label{fig:grid_J_L_K}
\end{figure}





The relationship between frequency, $J$ and $L$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:J_vs_L_vs_f+tc} (for $K_{\rm sym}=-80$ MeV). On the right side of the plot is the time before coalescence at which the corresponding gravitational wave frequencies occur, calculated by \citep{blanchet2006gravitational} %check this ref. is okay
\begin{align}
t_c-t=\frac{3}{8}t_{GW}=1.76\times 10^{-3}\rm{s}\left(\frac{\mathcal{M}}{1.2M_{\odot}}\right)^{-\frac{5}{3}}\left(\frac{f_{GW}}{1000 \rm{Hz}}\right)^{-\frac{8}{3}}.
\label{eq:t_before_merger}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\mathcal{M}=\frac{M_1^{\frac{3}{5}}M_2^{\frac{3}{5}}}{(M_1+M_2)^{\frac{1}{5}}}$ is the chirp mass and $t_c-t$ is the time before the merger. From this figure we can see that the frequency increases with increasing $J$ and decreasing $L$, and that the change over the $L$ range is greater than the change of the $J$ range, meaning that $L$ has a greater impact on the properties of the star that determine the i-mode frequency. Similarly, from figure \ref{fig:L_vs_K_vs_f+tc} we see that at low $L$ values, $K_{\rm sym}$ has a significant impact on the frequency, but as $L$ is increased, $K_{\rm sym}$'s impact decreases. Figures \ref{fig:grid_J_L_K}, \ref{fig:J_vs_L_vs_f+tc} and \ref{fig:L_vs_K_vs_f+tc} show that for a low frequency detection of an RSF, the constraints we could obtain for $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ would be weaker than for a higher frequency detection, while the strength of the constraint of $J$ is similar for both high and low i-mode frequencies. Note that some combinations of the symmetry energy parameters within our chosen ranges result in EoSs that are nonphysical, and therefore have been discarded. For example, we can see from figure \ref{fig:J_vs_L_vs_f+tc} that there is no EoS for $J=30$ MeV, $L=80$ MeV, $K_{\rm sym}=-80$ MeV.
%This can be seen from the decrease in $\frac{df}{dL}$ at lower frequencies in figure \ref{fig:L_vs_K_vs_f+tc}, and the reduction in the difference between the lines of constant $L$ in figure \ref{fig:J_vs_L_vs_f+tc}. Similarly, the lines of constant $K_{\rm sym}$ in figure \ref{fig:L_vs_K_vs_f+tc} bunch together at lower frequency, and so for a lower frequency detection our constraint would also be weaker on $K_{\rm sym}$. However, in figure \ref{fig:J_vs_L_vs_f+tc} we can see that $\frac{df}{dJ}$ is similar at high and low frequencies, and so the strength of the constraint we could apply to $J$ is mostly unaffected by the frequency of the detection. [UNCERTAIN ABOUT THIS PARAGRAPH]
%^check this for other constant J and Ksym values to make sure the trend holds.
%^basically, I want to explain why we have included these plots; how do they affect the story we are telling?
%^may be better to leave description of constraint strength until the contour plots?
%^also do a f vs Ksym plot at constant L with lines of constant J?
%lower f = closer L lines & reduced df/dL = weaker constraint on L
%lower f = closer K lines = weaker constraint on K
%lower f = similar df/dJ = similar constraint on J

\end{figure}


In order to better understand figure \ref{fig:grid_J_L_K}, we plot its projection on $J$ and $L$, shown in figure \ref{fig:freq_contours_plane}. The first plot of this figure shows the values of $J$ and $L$ that can result in the i-mode having the chosen frequency, with the spread in $L$ at any given $J$ being due to the range of possible $K_{\rm sym}$ values. We also do the same with the projection on $J$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, and on $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$. However, $J$ and $L$ have much larger impacts on the i-mode frequency than $K_{\rm sym}$, and therefore the spread is much larger. In particular, the frequency is so dependent on $L$ that higher frequencies can be obtained from almost any combination of $J$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ (within the ranges of the symmetry energy parameters that we have used here).

\end{figure}

%Other constant J,L,K values?

To calculate the constraints we could place on $J$, $L$, and $K_{\rm sym}$, we need to find the sources of uncertainty in the i-mode frequency. One such uncertainty is due to the timescale over which resonant excitation of a mode can occur. This can be calculated as \cite{tsang2012resonant}
\begin{align}
t_{\rm res}\sim 8\times10^{-2}\text{s}\left(\frac{\mathcal{M}}{1.2\text{M}_{\odot}}\right)^{\frac{-5}{6}}\left(\frac{f_{\rm mode}}{100 \text{ Hz}}\right)^{\frac{-11}{6}}.
\label{eq:res_timescale}    
\end{align}
\noindent This can be combined with the rate of change of the gravitational wave frequency
\begin{align}
\Dot{f}_{\rm gw}=\frac{f_{\rm gw}}{4.7\times10^{-3}\text{s}}\left(\frac{\mathcal{M}}{1.2\text{M}_{\odot}}\right)^{\frac{5}{3}}\left(\frac{f_{\rm gw}}{1000 \text{ Hz}}\right)^{\frac{8}{3}}
\label{eq:df_GW/dt}    
\end{align}
\noindent (where $f_{\rm gw}\approx f_{\rm mode}$) to obtain a simple estimate of the range of frequencies over which resonance can occur:
\begin{align}
\delta f\sim t_{\rm res}\Dot{f}_{\rm gw}\sim3.7\text{Hz}\left(\frac{\mathcal{M}}{1.2\text{M}_{\odot}}\right)^{\frac{5}{6}}\left(\frac{f_{\rm mode}}{100 \text{ Hz}}\right)^{\frac{11}{6}}.
\label{eq:freq_spread}    
\end{align}
\noindent From this we see that the resonance window gets larger as the frequency increases, with $\delta f$ scaling as $f_{\rm mode}^{\frac{11}{6}}$. For a chirp mass of $1.2M_{\odot}$ and a resonance at $100$ Hz, we get a frequency range of $\delta f\sim 3.7$ Hz, and for a resonance at $160$ Hz we get a range of $\delta f\sim 8.8$ Hz. This means that the spread of the frequency contours in the $J,L$ plane (seen in figure \ref{fig:t_res_spread}) is quite small ($\delta L\lesssim 5$ MeV), and therefore the impact of the resonance window is significantly less than that of the $K_{\rm sym}$ range, which causes a spread of $\sim 20$ MeV in $L$ at any given $J$ value. It should be noted that this is a very conservative estimate, and that by more accurately calculating both the rate at which energy is transferred into the modes and the breaking strain of the crust, this uncertainty could be significantly reduced by calculating the time it takes for the crust to shatter.

In figure \ref{fig:all_constraints} we plot the regions in $J$,$L$ that can give certain chosen frequencies when considering both the $K_{\rm sym}$ range (figure \ref{fig:freq_contours_plane}) and the resonance window (figure \ref{fig:t_res_spread}), and compare it to the combined nuclear constraints given in \citet{lattimer2013constraining} (which includes constrains from: fits to nuclear masses \citep{kortelainen2010nuclear}, neutron skin thickness \citep{chen2010density}, dipole polarisability \citep{piekarewicz2012electric}, giant dipole resonances \citep{trippa2008giant}, and isotope diffusion in heavy ion collisions \citep{tsang2009constraints}). From these results, in order to agree with the nuclear constraints, we could expect to observe precursor flares at $f_{GW}=150^{+130}_{-30}$ Hz. The range is very large because this figure shows the most conservative estimate of our $J$,$L$ constraints, with the upper bounds using $f\rightarrow f-\delta f$ Hz and $K_{\rm sym}=40$ MeV, and the lower bounds using $f\rightarrow f+\delta f$ Hz and $K_{\rm sym}=-200$ MeV, where our calculation of $\delta f$ is very conservative. We could also plot the regions in $J$,$K_{\rm sym}$ and $L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ that give the chosen frequencies, but we find that the strong dependence of the frequency on $J$ and $L$ means that these plots are uninformative. Therefore, in order to find more useful constraints, we can constrain the initial ranges of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ used to generate the EoSs.

\subsubsection{$J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ constrained using pure neutron matter theory}\label{subsec4_1_2}
\hspace{\parindent}The most relevant constraint for neutron stars comes from pure neutron matter theory. The ranges for the model parameters that agree with pure neutron matter theory are given by \citet{holt2018universal} as $24\leq J\leq 36$ MeV, $5.53\leq a_0\leq 6.41$ MeV fm$^3$ and $0\leq b_{12}\leq 16$ MeV fm$^3$, where $a_0$ and $b_{12}$ are related to $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ by \citep{newton2020nuclear}
\begin{align}
L=6.7J+C_L,
\end{align}
\begin{align}
K_{\rm sym}=18.4J+C_{K_{\rm sym}},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
C_L=-19.47a_0+1.56b_{12}-59.22,
\end{align}
\begin{align}
C_{K_{\rm sym}}=5(C_L+50.22)+7.79b_{12}-258.3.
\end{align}
\noindent Using a set of EoSs parametrised by values within these ranges (the PNM priors of \citet{newton2020nuclear}), we calculate the i-mode frequencies to obtain surfaces in the $J$,$L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space on which the frequency is constant, shown in figure \ref{fig:PNM_planes}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,angle=0]{PNM_planes}
\caption{Surfaces of constant frequency in the $J$,$L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space, where the $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ ranges are constrained by pure neutron matter theory. The surfaces are 20 Hz apart.}
\label{fig:PNM_planes}
\end{figure}

Similar to figure \ref{fig:freq_contours_plane}, figure \ref{fig:PNM_2d} shows two-dimensional projections of figure \ref{fig:PNM_planes}. The impact of each of the symmetry energy parameters can be seen from the plot in which they are not on either axis; for a given frequency, having a wider range of the y-axis parameter at any given x-axis value means that the symmetry energy parameter that is not on either axis has a greater impact on the i-mode frequency. We can see that $K_{\rm sym}$ has a small impact on the i-mode frequency because the spread in $L$ at any given $J$ value is small, particularly at higher $J$ values. We can also see (from the high spread in $K_{\rm sym}$ on the other two figures) that $L$ and $J$ both have large impacts on the i-mode frequency. The ranges of the symmetry energy parameters are much smaller than in Section \ref{subsec4_1_1}, and therefore by comparing figures \ref{fig:PNM_2d} and \ref{fig:freq_contours_plane} we can see that the spreads in the y-axis parameters are much  smaller.

To calculate the constraint that could be placed on $J$ and $L$, we calculate the resonance window using equation \ref{eq:freq_spread}. This, combined with the $K_{\rm sym}$ range, results in figure \ref{fig:PNM_JL_res_spread}, which shows the constraint we could apply to $J$ and $L$ for four different frequencies, alongside the combined nuclear physics constraints. By comparing figures \ref{fig:PNM_JL_res_spread} and \ref{fig:all_constraints}, we can see that requiring consistency with pure neutron matter theory has significantly tightened our constraints, with $f_{GW}=150^{+30}_{-30}$ Hz agreeing with the nuclear constraints. Our constraints are angled in the same direction as the nuclear constraints, and therefore a detection at $f=150$ Hz may only provide a small improvement to the constraints on $J$, and $L$. However, it should also be noted that if a precursor flare were to be detected at a higher or lower frequency, our constraints could be more interesting because the area in which they overlap with the nuclear constraints would be much smaller.

As the $J$ and $L$ ranges are much smaller than in Section \ref{subsec4_1_1}, the constraints that we could apply to $J$,$K_{\rm sym}$ and $L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ are much tighter. In figure \ref{fig:PNM_JK_res_spread} (\ref{fig:PNM_LK_res_spread}) we have plotted the constraint that could be applied to $J$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ ($L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$) due to an RSF detection, with the strength of the constraint being determined by the $L$ ($J$) range and the width of the resonance window.

\subsubsection{K$_{\rm sym}$ as a function of J and L}\label{subsec4_1_3}
\hspace{\parindent}In many Skyrme models, such as sly4 \citep{chabanat1998skyrme} and SkI6 \citep{reinhard1995nuclear,nazarewicz1996structure}, $K_{\rm sym}$ is not a free parameter. In order to better compare our results to works that use this type of model, we reproduced the $K_{\rm sym}$ dependence of the MSL0 interaction \citep{chen2010density} by defining \citep{newton2020nuclear}
\begin{align}
K_{\rm sym}=3.71L-11.13J+11.93\; \rm{MeV},
\end{align}
\noindent which restricts us to a single plane in the $J$,$L$,$K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space. This allows us to constrain the value of $K_{\rm sym}$ while still using the same Skyrme model. We calculated the i-mode frequency for a grid of $J$ and $L$ values to obtain figure \ref{fig:MSL0_J_L_f_tc}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,angle=0]{MSL0_J_L_f_tc}
\caption{The relationship between $J$, $L$, and the i-mode frequency for the MSL0-like $K_{\rm sym}$ dependence. As there is no $K_{\rm sym}$ range, this plot shows every EoS that we used in Section \ref{subsec4_1_3}.}
\label{fig:MSL0_J_L_f_tc}
\end{figure}

Next we interpolate between the EoSs to obtain frequency contours in the $J$,$L$ plane, shown in figure \ref{fig:MSL0_contours_20gap}. Now that $K_{\rm sym}$ is not a free parameter, the contours in the $J$,$L$ plane are only spread by the resonance window (equation \ref{eq:freq_spread}), giving us figure \ref{fig:MSL0_shaded_constraints}, where we have also plotted the nuclear physics constraints on $J$ and $L$. These results represent a best case scenario for the $K_{\rm sym}$ range, as there is no uncertainty in its value at all $J$ and $L$ values. From this figure we can see that a precursor flare detected at a gravitational wave frequency of $f_{GW}=140^{+40}_{-20}$ Hz would provide $J$,$L$ constraints that agree with those from nuclear physics. As for the previous set of EoSs, our constraints are in the same direction in the $J$,$L$ plane as the nuclear ones, which means that a detection at $140$ Hz may only provide a small improvement to the overall constraints.

\subsection{Shear speed}
%\hspace{\parindent}In order to find the cause of the change in frequency due to changes in $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, we investigated how the properties of the star change with $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$. We found that the density-weighted average of the shear speed in the crust was closely related to the i-mode frequency, which is what we would expect as the main restoring forces that causes the oscillation of the i-mode are shear forces. Figure \ref{fig:f_avct_MSL0} relates the frequency and the average shear speed for the each of the sets of EoSs that we have used in this work.

\hspace{\parindent}In order to find the cause of the change in frequency due to changes in $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, we investigated how the properties of the star change with $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$. As we predicted in section \ref{sec:stellar_structure}, the density-weighted average of the shear speed in the crust was closely related to the i-mode frequency. Figure \ref{fig:f_avct_MSL0} relates the frequency and the average shear speed for each of EoSs that we have used in this work.

\label{fig:f_avct_MSL0}
\end{figure}

In a similar way to how we obtained frequency contours in the $J$,$L$ plane, we can obtain average shear speed contours. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:avct_JL_MSL0} for the EoSs with the MSL0-like $K_{\rm sym}$ dependence, and from this we can see that these contours are similar to the frequency contours shown in figure \ref{fig:MSL0_contours_20gap}. However, the contours in these two plots become less similar at higher $J$ and $L$ values, meaning that properties other than the average shear speed become more significant at those values. We can also use the EoSs with weakly constrained symmetry energy parameters, and those constrained by PNM theory, to find the spread in the average shear speed contours in the $J$,$L$ plane due to $K_{\rm sym}$. This can be seen in figures \ref{fig:avct_JL_grid} and \ref{fig:avct_JL_PNM}

% \subsection{Relativistic perturbations}
% \hspace{\parindent}To investigate the impact of relativistic effects on the i-mode frequencies, we follow the method of \citet{yoshida2002nonradial} to calculate the relativistic perturbations of neutron stars within the relativistic Cowling approximation \citet{mcdermott1983nonradial} (where perturbations of the metric are ignored). With this modification, we obtain figures \ref{fig:grid_rel}-\ref{fig:PNM_rel}, which show the same results as figures \ref{fig:all_constraints}, \ref{fig:MSL0_shaded_constraints} and \ref{fig:PNM_JL_res_spread} but for relativistic perturbations. These figures show that relativistic effects reduce the i-mode frequencies that agree with nuclear constraints on $J$ and $L$ by approximately $20$ Hz. We also find that the differences between the non-relativistic and relativistic frequencies are greater at higher $J$ and $L$ values, and at lower $K_{\rm sym}$ values.

\section{Discussion}
\hspace{\parindent}We have calculated the relationship between the nuclear symmetry energy parameters within an extended Skyrme mean-field model and the neutron star interface mode frequency. We have used this to present theoretical constraints on the symmetry energy and its derivatives that could be obtained by coincident multimessenger detection of a resonant shattering flare during a NS merger. 

 Previous works have shown \citep{abbott2017gw170817,de2018tidal,abbott2018gw170817} that the gravitational wave chirp with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can constrain the tidal deformability, total mass, and total radius. These, in turn, place constraints on the neutron star equation of state \citep{annala2018gravitational,lim2018neutron} (primarily in the core). In this work, we examine the nuclear physics constraints (in particular on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters $J$, $L$, and $K_{\rm sym}$) that can be obtained by a future detection of a resonant shattering flare along with a gravitational-wave chirp. Timing of the RSF relative to the GW chirp can provide a direct measurement of the resonant frequency of the $\ell = 2$ core-crust interface mode  \citep{tsang2012resonant}. 
    
This mode frequency is dependent on properties of the neutron star near the core-crust boundary, and is thus sensitive to the nuclear symmetry energy parameters which determine (in a model dependent way), the properties of the neutron star near nuclear saturation. 



%We also investigated the relationship between the neutron star total radius, crust-core transition radius, total mass, and i-mode frequency, as well as how these relationships changed as the symmetry energy parameters were varied. We found that the frequency increased as the total mass was decreased (and the total radius was increased). For all three of the symmetry energy parameters that we studied, lowering the value of each of the symmetry energy parameters caused the total mass to have a greater impact on the frequency.

We constructed a set of equations of state parameterised by a grid of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ values following \citet{newton2020nuclear}. Solving for the i-mode frequencies, we were able to determine the constraint regions in the $J$, $L$, $K_{\rm sym}$ parameter space which correspond to different i-mode frequency values.

In Figure \ref{fig:f_avct_MSL0} we showed that the i-mode frequency is strongly dependent on the average (density-weighted) shear speed within the crust, which is dominated by the properties at the base of the crust, where density is highest. The dependence of the frequency on the symmetry energy parameters is thus dominated by their effects on the shear modulus distribution within the crust.
%may want to mention that the density distribution is relatively constant between EoSs
Figures \ref{fig:avct_JL_MSL0}, \ref{fig:avct_JL_grid} and \ref{fig:avct_JL_PNM} relate the shear speed to the symmetry energy parameters $J$ and $L$, \citep[similar to Figure 1 of ][]{steiner2009constraints}, connecting changes in the symmetry energy parameters to their impact on the average shear speed in the neutron star crust.  For a particular choice of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ we can determine how these symmetry energy parameters affect the shear speed (a local material property of the crust), which plays an important role in determining the frequency of the i-mode (a global property of the NS). While other global properties of the stellar structure that vary with the symmetry energy parameters (e.g. neutron star radius, radius of the core-crust transition) also play a role, we find that the i-mode frequency depends most strongly on the mean shear speed, as can be seem from the similarities between figures \ref{fig:avct_JL_MSL0}, \ref{fig:avct_JL_grid} and \ref{fig:avct_JL_PNM} and figures \ref{fig:MSL0_contours_20gap}, \ref{fig:all_constraints} and \ref{fig:PNM_JL_res_spread}.



The shear speed increasing with $J$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ and decreasing with $L$ is correlated with the impact of these changes on the symmetry energy in the crust (where $n<n_0$); increasing $J$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ and decreasing $L$ causes the symmetry energy in the crust to increase. However, \citet{steiner2009neutron} showed that the relationships between the symmetry energy and the size, density and composition of nuclei in the crust are not simple, and so while we can see that the average shear speed increases with increasing symmetry energy, a detailed description on why this is the case is beyond the scope of this work.
%Why do J and L affect the shear speed in this way? (Higher symmetry energy=larger proton fraction=larger shear modulus) (How does E_sym affect cluster size/seperation and density?)

%SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE AVG SHEAR SPEED DEPENDS ON J, L, AND K
%(mostly on L and K) Maybe steal a plot from Will's work, or construct our own




Assuming multimessenger coincident timing of a RSF, and determination of the i-mode frequency to a precision roughly determined by the duration of the flare, a conservative assumption of nuclear parameters consistent with pure neutron matter theory results provides constraints on $J$, $L$, and $K_{\rm sym}$ that are competitive with \citet{kortelainen2010nuclear}, \citet{chen2010density} and \citet{tsang2009constraints}. If we instead use a specific $K_{\rm sym}$ dependence, our results can provide significantly tighter constraints on $J$ and $L$ than these experimental results. Conversely, we can use the experimental results to obtain the range of frequencies at which we would expect to observe a RSF for a $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$ neutron star. This is shown in table \ref{tab:freq_to_match_nuclear}, with the expected frequency being $\sim 120-180$ Hz.


The results presented in this work are model dependant. We have used an extended Skyrme model, in which the maximum neutron star mass is chosen to be $2.2$ M$_{\odot}$, and the moment of inertia is assumed to be in the middle of the possible range. Using a different type of model may result in significantly different frequencies, with \citet{tsang2012resonant} showing i-mode frequencies as low as $30$ Hz. We have assumed a neutron star mass of $1.4$ M$_{\odot}$, but from figure \ref{fig:vary_mass_contours} we can see that a realistic degree of uncertainty in the stellar mass \citep{abbott2017merger} has a noticeable impact on the i-mode frequency. Therefore, uncertainty in the mass of the source of a detected RSF will widen our constraints, with its impact being similar to that of the resonance window. In this work we have used non-relativistic perturbations to obtain the wave-equation. The fully relativistic perturbations derived in \citet{yoshida2002nonradial} can result in 10\% changes in the mode frequencies, which is significant when compared to the width of our constraints on $J$ and $L$, and so we will explore this effect on the constraints in future work. We have worked within the Cowling approximation \citet{cowling1941non}, ignoring perturbations of the gravitational potential. We have also assumed that the binary lifetime is much longer than the neutron stars' spin-down and cooling timescales, and so we have ignored rotational and high temperature effects. Finally, we have not considered the impact of superfluidity in the core of a neutron star. Superfluidity allows protons and neutrons to move somewhat independently of each-other, introducing a new set of counter-moving normal modes \citet{andersson2001dynamics}, as well as modifying the frequency of modes that mainly oscillate within the core of the star.

%Something about future outlook and potential for detection and improvements to nuclear constraints from all sources. WILL HELP!
Resonant shattering flares from neutron stars can provide new powerful complementary astrophysical constraints on nuclear physics parameters by probing the bulk properties of neutron star matter near the crust/core transition, using upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, and existing Gamma-ray burst monitors, such as Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM to provide coincident timing. The rates of RSFs are currently uncertain, with precursor flares estimated to occur for 3 to 10\% of sGRBs, however, the recent coincident detection of a (slightly off-axis) sGRB and the chirp from GW170817 suggests a rate of NS mergers such that we may soon be able to determine these powerful constraints. 



























\iffalse
%first sentence is repeated. I think it fits better here, so remove/change the earlier occurrence.
Far from symmetry we would expect higher order symmetry energy parameters ($L$, $K_{\rm sym}$) to have a stronger impact on the frequency than lower order terms ($J$). From figure \ref{fig:freq_contours} this does seem to be the case, with the contours covering a wide range of $J$ values and a smaller range of $L$ values. $K_{\rm sym}$ also has a significant impact on the i-mode frequencies, with the extremes of our $K_{\rm sym}$ range having a difference of $\Delta L\sim 20$ MeV for the same $J$ values. Figure \ref{fig:constraints} shows contours for supposed detections of RSFs at several different frequencies, with the ranges for each frequency showing the effect of the $K_{\rm sym}$ range. We would expect the frequency of a precursor flare to be $\sim 100-150$ Hz, because precursor flares tend to occur roughly half a second before the merger \citet{zhong2019precursors}, and half a second before the merger, the frequency of GW170817 was $\sim 100-150$ Hz \citet{abbott2017merger}.

\subsection{Comparisons to other constraints}
There are many different constraints on the symmetry energy parameters that can be found from various properties of nuclei, such as the their masses \citet{kortelainen2010nuclear} and neutron skins \citet{chen2010density}. By plotting these constraints together, the symmetry energy parameters $J$ and $L$ can be constrained to a small range of values \citet{lattimer2013constraining}. This range is shown in figure \ref{fig:constraints} alongside the contours for RSFs at several different frequencies. From this figure we see that for an i-mode frequency of $160$ Hz, our constraint has a similar $L$ uncertainty as the nuclear constraints, and so a detection at this value would help provide evidence the currently known constraints on $J$ and $L$. However, for an i-mode frequency of $200$ Hz, the constraint is shifted to significantly lower L values and therefore a detection of a precursor at $200$ Hz would improve the previous constraints on $J$ and $L$ because of the smaller overlap with the nuclear constraints. %Cite Lattimer and mention that the dipole polarisability is wrong?
% on the graph of constraints in the J,L plane, my results are similar to those for dipole polarisability
% constrain K using the J,L values?

Figure \ref{fig:all_constraints} shows the combination of the spread in frequency due to $t_{\rm res}$ and the spread in $L$ due to the range of $K_{\rm sym}$ values used. This figure shows the most conservative estimate of the $J$, $L$ constraints, with the upper bounds using $f\rightarrow f-\delta f$ Hz and $K_{\rm sym}=40$ MeV, and the lower bounds using $f\rightarrow f+\delta f$ Hz and $K_{\rm sym}=-200$ MeV. The ranges shown in this figure are slightly different to figure \ref{fig:constraints}, but the main uncertainty is the $K_{\rm sym}$ range.
